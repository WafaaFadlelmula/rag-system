To  achieve  this,  the  scope  of  the ECOICE project includes both technical and commercial deliverables. The technical deliverables include technical  development  activities  to  construct  key  components  of  the  C-PON  architecture  into commercial product form. Such components include C-PON network interface card (NIC) card, OLM, the optical backplane, and the control software. Technical development activities of the project also include  the  integration  of  all  essential  C-PON  components  to  create  a  functional  C-PON  cell.  The technical development activities of the ECOICE project are complemented by commercial deliverables which aim to engage and collaborate with industrial partners to identify potential use cases and their corresponding requirements which will inform and focus the technical development activities of the project.\n\nBoth technical development activities and commercial engagements are expected to lead to the construction of a testbed (i.e., C-PON demonstration prototype) where key performance indicators (i.e., latency, power consumption and resilience) of the C-PON platform can be monitored, measured, and  optimised  in  lab  environment  and  in  field  trial  test  sites  of  industrial  partners.  The  testbed  is expected to demonstrate reduction in power consumption, reduction in latency and greater resilience. The  testbed  should  provide  an  agile,  flexible,  and  scalable  platform  which  can  efficiently  utilise resources to satisfy dynamic demand patterns.\n\nAchieving both technical and commercial deliverables of the ECOICE project is expected to de-risk the C-PON technology for venture funds (by advancing the C-PON technology from TRL3 to  TRL6). Hence,  the  ECOICE  project  will  provide  a  prototype  that  will  enable  third  parties  to  validate  both business and technical propositions of the C-PON technology.",

Thus, optical backplanes provide an exclusive intra-rack fabric between servers in the same rack. Several options considered to implement the backplane include fiber Bragg grating, optical polymer backplanes, optical packet switches, and optical circuit switches.\n\nDT7 gave advanced specification of candidates C-PON optical backplane to replace the electrical switch used in the TRL3 lab demonstrator of the C-PON technology. Furthermore, the implementation of a C-PON testbed as reported in DT14 adopts a fibre optic system to implement a full mesh optical backplane for the C-PON tested. This fibre optic system of a full mesh optical backplane mimics a smallscale optical polymer backplane. Consequently, OEO conversion and power consumption is reduced relative to the previously developed lab-based demonstrator of the C-PON technology which existed before the ECOICE project.",

In DT12, ONOS was leveraged to implement a software defined network (SDN) controller (i.e., control software) for the C-PON testbed. Consequently, coordination of communication within the C-PON cell and between cells  in  the  C-PON  platform  is  attained  using  C-PON  control  protocols  and  an  open-source  SDN controller which can also be fully developed at commercial grade.",

At a high level, the C-PON testbed comprise the following physical components:\n\n- Two Racks: Two steel frames are utilised to accommodate the servers, network devices, cables, and other equipment. Server are distributed over the two racks. The first rack contains three servers while the second rack consists of two servers.\n- Five Servers: The servers within each rack in the C-PON testbed are divided into two categories i.e.,  relay  servers  and  normal  servers.  In  contrast  to  normal  servers,  relay  servers  have additional responsibility of forwarding traffic from adjacent servers within the rack to other servers in different racks or to the OLM. Each server is equipped with one or more U25 Xilinx smart NIC and optical transceivers.\n- Optical Line Manager (OLM): The OLM is implemented by leveraging the chassis of a server as illustrated in Figure 1. However, a special software (i.e., the control software) is installed in server to coordinate the traffic exchange within the C-PON testbed. The OLM also has a direct link to one of relay server in each rack. Such link is responsible for conveying the regular traffic as well as in-band signalling for coordination and control.\n- Optical  Fibre: Optical  fibre  provides  physical  media  that  are  employed  to  enable  inter-rack connectivity between servers in the C-PON testbed as well as server-to-OLM connectivity.\n- Backplane: The backplane is an integral component of the C-PON cell that provides an exclusive intra-rack  fabric  between  the  servers  within  each  rack.  A  mesh  topology  of  optical  fibre  is utilised to represent a passive optical backplane in the C-PON testbed.\n\nFigure 1: Physical Architecture of the C-PON Testbed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

    "text": "Memory fine-tuning is a process that involves optimising memory settings to enhance network performance, efficiency, isolation, and resource utilisation. Such tuning in the configuration of the Xilinx U25 smart NICs improves the efficiency of the C-PON cards. The Xilinx U25 support two memory models, namely, shared memory model and per-port memory model.  A brief description of each model is provided as follows.\n\n- Shared Memory Model : In the shared memory model, all ports on the SmartNIC concurrently share  a  memory  pool.  This  arrangement  simplifies  memory  management  by  centralising resources  and  allows  dynamic  allocation  of  the  resources  based  on  demand  and  hence, maximises resource utilisation. However, this model lacks isolation. This is noticeable if a single port requires intensive operations which can adversely affect the utilised resources of other ports. Additionally, when multiple ports access the shared memory simultaneously, a possibility of contention for resources arises which may potentially lead to inevitable bottlenecks.\n\n- Per-Port Memory Model : In the per-port memory model, each port within the SmartNIC has its own dedicated memory resources which offers several advantages. Such dedicated resources provide  strong  isolation  which  ensures  that  each  port  operates  independently  within  its allocated memory space, and therefore enhances security and reliability. Moreover, this model facilitates  predictable  performance  since  each  port  operates  with  its  memory  resources, minimising contention, and leading to more consistent performance. However, applying this model may increase the complexity associated with managing memory resources for individual ports,  which  requires  careful  allocation  and  monitoring.  Furthermore,  there  is  a  risk  of inefficient resource utilisation if some ports do not fully utilise their dedicated memory, leading to resource wastage.\n\nThe implementation of the C-PON cards in previous ECOICE reports employed a shared memory model. However, in this report the per-port memory model is adopted. We utilise a per-port model in the refined  implementation  of  the  C-PON  testbed,  since  it  offers  high  security,  predictable performance,  and  robust  resource  allocation.  Additionally,  employing  per-port  model  leads  to separating the receiving (rx) queues into two queues. Such queues serve as dedicated pipelines for data moving out of the SmartNIC. The use of separate queues enhances control over data flow, facilitates efficient prioritisation of tasks, and enables the implementation of quality of service (QoS) features.\n\nFurthermore,  selecting  an  appropriate  buffer  size  is  a  critical  aspect  of  memory  fine-tuning  in SmartNICs. Therefore, the size of the buffer is updated to be aligned with the per-port model. The buffer size is upgraded from 1024 bytes to 2048 bytes. This size is a balance between efficient memory utilisation and the ability to handle data bursts effectively.",

    "text": "In previous setup of the C-PON testbed, the lookup process matches the packets based on all matching fields. However, a more efficient approach is applied to optimise the match-action lookup process and to speed up data handling. This approach involves matching mainly with IPv4 and MAC fields  and  disregarding  other  matching  fields.  By  concentrating  only  on  these  IPv4  and  MAC  fields, SmartNICs can expedite decision-making, reduce processing latency, and enhance overall operational efficiency. By exclusively considering IPv4 and MAC matches, SmartNICs can rapidly identify packets that require specific treatment based on these essential attributes. This approach proves particularly advantageous in scenarios where rapid packet classification and routing decisions are crucial, such as data centres, network accelerators, and appliances managing high volumes of network traffic. This optimisation  not  only  accelerates  decision-making  but  also  reduces  the  computational  load  on SmartNICs, resulting in lower processing overhead and decreased power consumption.

    "text": "C­PON is a high resilient, highly reliable platform for cloud or edge data centres (DCs). Reliability and resilience  in  the  C-PON  platform  is  achieved  via  two  complementary  ways  i.e., via  the  control software and via the existence of multiple connection paths between servers. On the one hand, the control software of the C-PON platform is designed to effectively monitor network topology and to rapidly update forwarding tables to reflect and adjust to changes in the network topology. On the other hand, the reliability of the C-PON platform is facilitated by the existence of multiple routes between servers. This ensures seamless traffic transmission regardless of failure(s) in the network.\n\nNetwork  failure  refers  to  breakdown  or  disruption  of  communication  within  the  networks. Mitigation of the effects of network failures is crucial to ensure continuous and reliable communication. Network failures can be divided into two main types: node failures and link failures. Each type is briefly described as follows.\n\n- -Node  Failure: In  the  C-PON  platform,  this  entails  the  failure  of  servers,  the  OLM,  or  the backplane.\n- o Server Failure: The impact of a server failure on the network depends on the type of server. There are two types of servers in the C-PON testbed i.e., normal servers and relay servers.\n- Normal Server: The impact of the failure of a normal server is minimal since such a  failure  can  be  isolated  to  the  failed  normal  server.  This  is  because  normal servers have no direct links with other servers or with the OLM.\n- Relay Server: Relay servers have direct connections with the OLM or with servers in adjacent racks. Therefore, the failure of a relay server has a direct impact on other elements of the cell. If a relay server goes down, all links directly attached to the failed relay server are directly impacted.  However,  the  physical architecture of the C-PON platform enables communication to be maintained using alternative routes.\n- o OLM Failure: OLM is the brain of the C-PON cell. Therefore, an OLM failure affects all cells that are connected to that OLM. An OLM failure leads to the failure of all links connecting that OLM to servers in affected cells. Furthermore, the forwarding tables of network  nodes  will  not  be  updated  when  changes  occur  in  the  network  topology. Likewise, servers impacted by an OLM failure cannot interact with servers in other cells or send traffic to the internet. However, communication between servers within the same cell can be maintained via alternative routes provided that no other components has  failed.  To  further  improve  the  C-PON  platform  in  the  future,  a  consideration  of additional backup OLM can be introduced. Alternatively, a replica (or replicas) of the control  software  can  be  embedded  into  one  (or  more  than  one)  of  the  servers  to maintain the network in case of the failure of the main control software.\n- o Backplane Failure: The backplane is an essential component that connect servers within the same rack. Backplane failure leads to the loss of communication between the servers in the same rack.",

Such failure results to the selection of an alternative path for communication between S1 and other servers (or the OLM). A single inter-rack link failure can also occur when the dedicated link that connects two relay servers is severed. To demonstrate the resilience of the C-PON testbed under single inter-rack link failure, the test scenario illustrated in Figure 12 is implemented.\n\nFigure 15: Single (inter-rack) link failure test scenario in C-PON testbed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn this assessment, we initiated a controlled traffic load between two ports of the traffic generator. Specifically, we connected the input port of the traffic generator to one of the ports on the C-PON card located on server S1, while the output port was linked to the fourth port on the C-PON card of server S6. Subsequently, we verified the seamless flow of traffic between these input and output ports of the traffic  generator.  After  that,  we  physically  disconnected  the  link  between  server  S1  and  server  S3, denoted as the S1-S3 link, to introduce a single inter-rack link failure as illustrated in Figure 12.\n\nOur observations demonstrated that as soon as the control software detected the severed link using  LLDP  discovery  packets,  it  promptly  recomputed  the  alternative  routes  between  the  two endpoints  and  initiated  updates  to  the  match-action  table  entries  on  the  active  C-PON  cards.

    "text": "This scenario investigates CPON's resilience during the combined occurrence of intra-rack link and inter-rack link failures. Using the constructed C-PON testbed, failure of one inter-rack link (S2-S6) and an intra-rack  link  (S4-S6)  was  implemented as illustrated in  Figure  16.  The  outcome  of  the  test,  as illustrated in Figure 17, demonstrates C-PON ' s resilience under the combined occurrence of intra-rack and inter-rack link failure. However, it is important to highlight that under other scenarios where both intra-rack and inter-rack links fail concurrently, the testbed may become non-functional.\n\nIn this scenario, the input link of the traffic generator is connected to S2 port, and the output link is connected to the S6 port. Then we applied the traffic loads of 2.5 Gbps and 25 Gbps in C-PON testbed for the intra-rack and inter-rack links failure test scenario.  When the connection is initiated in the first\n\nplace between the endpoints S2 and S6, the traffic seamlessly flows through the direct link (S2-S6). Subsequently, we physically detached the direct inter-rack link (S2-S6) and the intra-rack link (S4-S6).\n\nWe noticed that the flows of both applied traffic loads are redirected through an indirect route (S2S1-S3-S4-S5-S6) when the control software detected the failed links. The resulting throughput of traffic sent  under  both  traffic  loads  (i.e.,  2.5  Gbps  and  25  Gbps)  are  illustrated  in  Figures  18  and  19, respectively.\n\nUnder both applied traffic loads, we observed that the recovery time gap is slightly higher than the inter-rack and intra-rack single link failure scenarios. This can be attributed to the centralised decision process of the control software that requires coordination between all interconnected C-PON cards across all active servers in both racks. However, the two-links failure scenario across different racks is an extreme resilience use case and it has shown that the C-PON architecture is capable to recover from failure and efficiently maintain the traffic flows within C-PON cell.\n\nFigure 19: Combination of intra-rack and inter-rack link failures scenarios in C-PON testbed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 20: Communication path via C-PON testbed as detected by the control software after a combined failure of intra-rack and inter-rack links.\n\nFigure 21: Throughput of traffic sent via the C-PON testbed at 2.5 Gbps traffic load after combined failure of intra-rack and inter-rack links.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 22: Throughput of traffic sent via the C-PON testbed at 25 Gbps traffic load after combined failure of intra-rack and inter-rack links.\n\n<!-- image -->",

AR/VRassisted event viewing adopts extended reality (XR) technology to process captured contents from live events. These processed contents are subsequently sent back to fans at the location of the event to deliver memorable immersive experiences.\n\nThe architectural setup of AR/VR-assisted event viewing in stadiums, as illustrated in Figure 20, begins with distributed sensors (including IoT devices and cameras) which capture and encode video and  data  streams.  Subsequently,  the  ecosystem  leverages  network  infrastructure  to  transmit  the captured streams to a remote processing location at the edge of the network. In the edge computing pod, the captured and encoded content is decoded and stored prior to transformation of the collected data into insights by data analytics software and/or the rendering of video graphics by XR rendering software.  Furthermore,  a  multimedia  stitching  software  can  be  used  to  combine  processed  video, audio,  and  data  streams.

AR/VR application provide enhanced experience in  factories  by superimposing real-time data and virtual objects onto a cabinet, machine, or entire plant. For example, smart glasses with embedded AR features can be used to provide remote support to  technician  on  the  factory  floor.  Likewise,  smart  glasses  and  similar  devices  can  optimise  fault diagnosis and maintenance and repairs tasks being undertaking by technician within factory premises. These use cases of AR/VR applications in manufacturing factories require low latency, high resilience, and high bandwidth. The enhanced experience delivered by AR/VR applications in factory of the future enables greater accuracy, optimised performance and improved productivity which can significantly improve the efficiency of manufacturing operations.\n\nThe  identification  and  selection  of  this  use  case  of  the  AR/VR  application  is  an  outcome  of commercial engagements with Vodafone. The goal of demonstrating this AR/VR application  in  the\n\nfactory of the future is the adoption of C-PON technology to provide edge computing capacity for AR/VR  applications  that  enable  enhanced  experiences  in  factories.  C-PON  can  provide  an  energy efficient edge computing platform to effectively support the deployment of AR/VR technologies in next generation factories. This is because the C-PON technology offers low latency, high resilience and high bandwidth that is required to support AR/VR applications and their use cases.",

    "text": "In  showcasing  the  AR/VR  use  case  within  our  C-PON  testbed,  we  conducted  a  comprehensive analysis of network traffic packet capture (PCAP) files for three distinct AR/VR applications. These PCAP files  contain the traced traffic between a single AR/VR headset (i.e., OCULUS Quest) and an AR/VR rendering server. Through the statistical analysis using Wireshark packet analyser, we observed that the AR/VR communicated traffic consists of UDP packets and 98% of these packets are encapsulated within frames ranging in size from 64 to 1280 bytes.\n\nNext,  we  utilised  the  integrated  test  automation  tool  of  the  Xena  Valkyrie  traffic  generator  to replicate a customised traffic behaviour similar to the examined AR/VR network traffic. The replicated traffic behaviour is applied to the C-PON and spine and leaf testbeds to facilitate series of performance tests involving throughput, delay, jitter, and packet loss. These performance tests were conducted at both 50% and 100% link rates.",

Specifically, the average delay in the spineand-leaf testbed was 2.7 microseconds, whereas the C-PON testbed exhibited an average delay of 30 microseconds.\n\nAt  100% link rate, we observed that the average delay of the spine-and-leaf testbed increased considerably across all frame sizes with average delay of 18 microseconds. At 64-byte frame size, the average delay of the C-PON is 16.9 microseconds which is lower than the average delay of the spineand-leaf testbed at the same frame size. However, as the frame sizes increased, there is a proportional increase in the average delay measured in C-PON testbed, as illustrated in Figure 30.\n\nDespite the significant average delay margin between the C-PON and the spine-and-leaf testbeds, the C-PON testbed successfully met the RFC 2544 test benchmarks for the delay metric. Nonetheless,\n\nthere  remains  room  for  further  enhancement  and  optimisation,  bearing  in  mind  the  constraints imposed by the design platform (i.e., Xilinx U25 smart NIC) and power consumption limitations.

The results in 34 and Figure 35 revealed that a substantial incidence of packet loss was detected within the C-PON setup when the 64byte frame size is considered. In contrast, the spine-and-leaf setup exhibited small packet loss in 64byte frames and no discernible packet loss across other tested frame sizes.\n\nWe investigated the considerable packet loss incidence in the C-PON testbed for the case of 64byte frames. The outcome  of the investigation showed that  the  64-byte frame size represents the minimum ethernet frame size that contains only headers without the necessary minimum data size of 46 bytes that is required to process the frame using the current C-PON card pipelines. The C-PON card pipelines design will be further optimised to allocate and process similar non-standardised ethernet frames.\n\nFigure 34: Average packet loss of AR/VR traffic demonstration at 50% link rate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 35: Average packet loss of AR/VR traffic demonstration at 100% link rate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

    "text": "The  completion  of  all  tasks  and  deliverables  in  the  ECOICE  project  is  not  without  challenges. However,  the  team  of  engineers  on  the  project  were  able  to  mitigate  the  challenges  to  ensure successful completion of the ECOICE project. Some notable challenges are discussed as follows.\n\n- Impact of COVID19 on Supply Chain: The purchase of hardware required to implement the project was delayed because of the impact of COVID19 pandemic on the supply chain. This caused over 6 months delay in the implementation timeline of the project. However, Ultracell 's implementation  engineers  were  able  to  mitigate  this  challenge  by  progressing  technical development activities via simulation and emulation of the expected architectural setup of the C-PON  technology.  This  approach  expedited  the  implementation  of  C-PON  technology  on physical hardware when purchased hardware eventually arrived.\n- Cost  of  Hardware :  Cost  FPGA  NIC  cards  and  compatible  servers  was  higher  than  the  price quoted in project proposal. Consequently, we have had to reduce size of the demonstration prototype constructed as part of the ECOICE project to stay within the project ' s budget.\n- Commercial  Availability  of  Implementation  Hardware: Optical  polymer  backplane  was  a leading  backplane  solution  desired  for  implementation  of  C-PON  technology.  However,  the optical polymer backplane is not commercially available. Hence, we had to resort to the use of a  full  mesh  fibre  optic  system  to  implement  a  makeshift  optical  backplane  for  the  C-PON demonstrator.  Additionally,  optical  circuit  switches  which  offers  an  alternative  backplane solution were also not readily available in the market.\n- Availability of Xilinx U25 SmartNIC : During the ECOICE project, the Xilinx was acquired by AMD. The acquisition might have led to the production of the Xilinx U25 SmartNIC being discontinued. However, we were able to mitigate this situation  by working closely with  our partners and suppliers to stockpile the smart NIC cards in the required quantity.\n- Timeline for Field Trials: The  timeline  proposed for  field  trials  with  commercial  partners  as proposed in the project proposal proved inadequate during the project implementation phase. This is because some commercial partners such as Vodafone wanted a trial period of six months (for the C-PON demonstration testbed in their network sites). Likewise, BT preferred that an academic journal article be completed to obtain much needed buy-in from BT engineers before\n\na  trial  can  be  initiated.  To  mitigate  these  challenges,  a  trial  is  being  conducted  at  Ultracell Networks lab. The trial mimics potential trial scenarios discussed with our commercial partners. This in-house trial has helped to provide data that will be reported in the journal paper being requested by BT and will help to obtain much needed buy-in for a field trial at a future date. Similarly, the same data will be presented to Vodafone to motivate further interest in trials which will be conducted after the current milestone of the project.",

    "text": "Several  invaluable  lessons  have  been  learned  in  the  development  of  C-PON  technology  in  the ECOICE project. These lessons are summarised as follows.\n\n- Need to Refactor Development Hardware: FPGA capacity in C-PON card is over provisioned for required functions that the C-PON card performs in C-PON platform. Likewise, the adoption of a  x86  server  chassis  to  implement  an  OLM  comes  with  overheads.  Since,  several  intrinsic components  of  a  generic  server  are  not  required  to  implement  the  OLM.  Hence,  such development hardware needs to be refactored as the C-PON technology is developed into its final size for commercial deployment. Such refactoring would reduce power consumption and cost of the individual components of the C-PON technology and the collective cost and power consumption of C-PON platforms that are deployed at the edge and in the cloud.\n- Leveraging of Open-Source Technologies: The development of the C-PON technology in the ECOICE project leveraged open-source technologies by adopting the P4 language and the ONOS. The P4 language, which is an open source, domain-specific programming language for network devices, was used to develop the C-PON cards which are placed in servers and in the OLM. In a similar manner, the ONOS which is an open-source SDN controller was leveraged to implement the control software for the C-PON platform. Both open-source technologies proved effective for  the  implementation  of  the  C-PON  technology  in  the  ECOICE  project.  Hence,  such technologies will be explored further as the C-PON technology development is advanced to higher TRLs.\n- Prototyping in Software: The use of emulator and simulators to develop prototypes of the CPON testbed prior to implementation on physical hardware enabled seamless development of the C-PON platform. Emulators and simulators provide platforms for development and testing prior to implementation in physical hardware. As the C-PON technology development advances to higher TRLs, this approach will be maintained as much as possible.\n- Strict  Procurement  Policy: Early  in  the  ECOICE  project,  a  procurement  policy  to  ensure compatibility between purchased components was put in place for the project. Strict adherence to this policy ensured that the servers (Lenovo ThinkSystem SR665 servers) purchased were compatible with Xilinx U25 SmartNIC. Furthermore, compatible optical transceivers, optical and\n\nDAC cables were also purchased. This procurement policy ensures minimal  funds and timer wastage  during  the  ECOICE  project.  Consequently,  this  strict  procurement  policy  will  be sustained as C-PON technology is developed to higher TRLs.",

    "text": "Ultracell Networks Ltd has prepared this document for BEIS as evidentiary information of achievement of key milestones and objectives relating to the Cellular Passive Optical Networks (C-PON) platfom of the Energy-efficient Cellular Optical Interconnects for Clouds and Edge-processing (ECOICE) project. We are confident that we have understood and met the objectives and are providing a high quality, value-based report that meets the requirements as defined in the project. In summary:\n\n- We achieved the first technical deliverable (i.e., DT1 Within WP1) which is for the initial draft specification  of  the  C-PON  card  to  be  implemented  on  FPGA).  We  defined  the  required functional block to perform traffic forwarding in the C-PON platform. This is to be implemented through P4 FPGA programming to the C-PON card. We furthermore provide initial identification of the required functional blocks of the C-PON controller (i.e., the OLM) to perform routing and control  functions  and  identified  resilience  and  load  balancing  features  for  C-PON.  We  also defined a development plan with five stages to implement the C-PON platform progressively in the ECOICE project.\n- We achieved the first commercial deliverable (i.e., DC1 Within WP6) which is for the Initial draft specification of the first use case with Vodafone or BT on edge processing for applications such as Ultra Reliable Low Latency (URLL) IoT or vehicular use cases. We engaged with Vodafone and identified  three  key  edge  processing  use  cases  for  C-PON  which  are  smart  factory,  smart healthcare and vehicular communication. We provide the initial descriptions of these use cases.\n\nThis  ambitious  programme  will  directly  contribute  towards  UK  becoming  a  low-carbon  economy enabling data center and network operators to manage their energy usage, reduce costs and reduce carbon emissions.  In this regard, it is of critical national importance.\n\nThis document forms a detailed report on the work undertaken on the C-PON platform of the ECOICE project from 1 st October 2021 to 15 th   January 2022, focused on the first technical and commercial deliverables. The organisation of this report is as follows:\n\n- Section 1 is an introduction.\n- Section 2 gives an overview of C-PON.\n- Section 3 describes the deliverables of ECOICE.\n- Section 4 discusses the first technical deliverable; specifically on developing a C-PON card.\n- Section  5 provides  details  of  further  technical  progress  and  the  proposed    C-PON  platform development plan.\n- Section 6 details the first commercial deliverable and focuses on developing the draft(s) of CPON platform use cases based on the initial interaction with Vodafone.",

For example:\n\n- Offering effective intra-rack connections between servers and inter-rack connections between servers in different racks.\n- Multiple connections between different servers to reduce bottlenecks and increase resilience.\n- C-PON utilises customised Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols to provide the symmetric link speeds demanded by server-to-server traffic in DCs.\n\nC-PON platforms have a cellular structure where several racks are bundled as a C-PON cell, and several cells construct the C-PON platform.\n\nFigure 1: C-PON Cell components.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The C-PON fabric allows multiple redundant, reconfigurable, direct, high-bandwidth routes between the servers.\n\nThe structure of the C-PON fabric allows the C-PON platform to be scaled-up efficiently to hundreds of thousands of servers while mostly using passive optical devices. The structure also enables on-demand addition of extra 'cells' enabling a 'pay -as-yougrow' model.

US patent number: US10498450B2, 3 December 2019 (US20170324480A1).\n3. China patent number CN107210837B, 9 August 2019.\n4. EU patent number EP3224972A1, 22 September 2021.\n5. Japan patent number JP6675400B2, 1 April 2020.\n\nThe patent includes several designs for the intra-rack PON and the inter-rack PON (i.e., the C-PON fabric) as shown in Figure 3 .\n\nThe  different  designs  utilise  different  passive  devices  to  suit  different  operational  scenarios  and networking requirements. Intra-rack PON (i.e., the backplane) can be a star coupler, a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) that reflects selected wavelengths between servers, or a multimode polymer waveguide that provides non-blocking full mesh connectivity with 10 Gb/s -100 Gb/s and beyond data rates per waveguide [1], as can be seen in Figure 3 (d), (e) and (f), respectively. An active programmable optical switch can be also used as a backplane.\n\nThe C-PON fabric can use one of three main designs as shown in Figure 3 . All three designs provide additional  passive  links  between  the  servers  and  hence  reduce the  need  to  forward  the  DC traffic through the OLM which reduces the power consumption and delay.\n\nThe design in Figure 3 (a) utilises direct links between the racks and utilises the C-PON cards to forward the traffic. This design is categorised as a servercentric design and is described as 'option 5' in the patent. The features this design offers are low-cost, low power consumption, and high-resilience due to the availability of several alternative routes between the servers in the C-PON cell.\n\nThe design in Figure 3 (b) utilises passive routing devices known as Arrayed Waveguide Grating Routers (AWGRs). An AWGR is a wavelength router that uses multiple wavelengths to interconnect its outputs and inputs by following a specific wavelength routing  pattern. This design, described as 'option 3' in the patent, offers the features of low power consumption, high-performance, high-throughput and low-latency due to having only passive hops between the servers in the C-PON cell and the OLM. This design requires tuneable transceivers in the C-PON card, which increases the costs and hence, this design suits the applications that involve high computational workloads and require high performance.\n\nThe third design in Figure 3 (c) , described as 'option 4' in the patent, is a hybrid design that uses AWGRs, gateway servers, and tuneable lasers only at the gateway servers. This design reduces the costs while offering an intermediate level of performance between the two other architectures.\n\nssis 2\n\nText xt\n\nOLT\n\nCard\n\n16\n\nWGR\n\nAWGR-1\n\n4x4\n\nAWGR-2\n\n4x4\n\nFBG\n\nFBG\n\nOLT\n\nCard\n\nOLT\n\nCard\n\nAWGR\n\nRack\n\n3\n\nAWGR",

    "text": "The  Xilinx®  Alveo ™ SN1000  SmartNICs  is  a  platform  that  provides  computing,  network convergence and storage acceleration. As shown in Figure 4, the card can mount into a single PCI Express slot with half-length and in a full height form. It consists of two QSFP28 connections, where one is active, and the other is a loopback. This card supports 100GbE network configuration with up to 75W  of  electrical  power  limit.  The  use  of  the  LX2162A  processor  with  the  XCU26  FPGA  enables hardware  acceleration  in  networking,  computing,  and  storage.  This  acceleration  helps  avoid unnecessary data movements and CPU processing and allows cloud service providers to have efficient CPU processing by offloading infrastructure workloads to the SmartNIC.

    "text": "ECOICE has seven highly inter-related work packages to move from TRL3 to TRL6:\n\n- WP1  Developing  the  C-PON  Card: focuses  on  programming  the  C-PON  cards  to  achieve communication in the C-PON cell. The communication software can be implemented in a Net-FPGA card or the recent Xilinx Smart NIC platform developed for Xilinx by Solarflare offering up to 100 Gb/s. Currently the C-PON communication and control software is implemented in the operating system of the servers in our lab. This is slow and is not the product to be sold. This activity requires programming of the FPGA chip in the C-PON card to offload networking functions from the servers.\n- WP2 Developing the OLM : The Optical Line Manager (OLM) terminates signals from the cards in the different servers. FPGA and software development is needed. The OLM functions are implemented now in the operating system of the servers in the current demo. This workpackage aims to develop a complete control software for the OLM at commercial grade in one or more networked FPGA based NICs.\n- WP3 C-PON cell development :  There are three main C-PON cell architectures and each requires different  FPGA  programming  of  the  card  and  the  OLM.  One  cell  architecture  provides  high performance and calls for fast tuneable transceivers and AWGRs, which are commercially available. The second cell architecture is a low-cost high resilience architecture. The third cell architecture is a compromise. Each architecture is better suited to a different use case. This work package focuses on customization of development activities for C-PON cards and OLM according to cell architecture chosen and use case parameters and requirements.\n- WP4 Control  Software :  This  development  will  be  guided  by  the  use  cases.  The  software  in  its simplest form will provide interfaces between C-PON cards and OLM. More sophisticated versions will enable C-PON cells to be joined together through the OLM to enable processing to be moved (i.e., a heavily loaded C-PON cell borrows servers from nearby C-PON cells). Other features of the software  will  enable  slicing  and  will  allow  C-PONs  to  interface  with  BT  (and  other)  slicing  / virtualisation software.\n- WP5 Optical Backplane Development : This will be built using Fibre Bragg Gratings (FBG) which are commercially available and transceivers whose wavelength is reflected by the FBG, with time slots added to enable different size flows to be supported. The software that controls the backplane will be embedded in the C-PON card FPGA. The current demo uses an electronic switch to provide the backplane in each rack.\n- WP6 Commercial development :  This  will  be  sub-contracted; however, the subcontractor will be linked to our industrial collaborators and to our wider set of C-PON industrial contacts. The focus will be on the companies we have already engaged with so far including BT, Vodafone, Cisco, Orange, and others; to identify 1 -2 use cases that become the focus of the commercial customisation of CPON in ECOICE.",

If multiple equal cost paths exist between a source and a destination node, ECMP randomly select a path from the list of equal cost paths on which to send each flow of the traffic that is being transmitted.

As illustrated in Figure 13 (b), the receiving server will check the incoming traffic and if a packet within a flow is not received, it  sends a (trigger) control message to the OLM. Otherwise, the receiving server continues to check until the flow transmission completes. The OLM then checks first if the transmitting server is active. If yes, the OLM marks the current assigned path (i.e., collection of links between the transmitting and receiving servers) as unavailable or failed and then recalculates the route and updates the routing tables  accordingly.  Then,  the  OLM  issues  new  control  messages  to  the  transmitting  and  receiving servers  to  restart  the  transmission.  If  the  transmitting  server  is  unavailable,  then  it  informs  the receiving  server  so  it  can  issue  a  new  request  from  another  server  that  has  a  copy  of  the  same requested data.

These changing market conditions require smart and adaptable manufacturing factories. To  achieve this and more, manufacturer and other factory operators are leveraging strongly emerging technological trends to satisfy changing and specific consumer needs in an efficient and sustainable manner.\n\nExamples of technologies being used or considered include IoT, cloud computing, edge computing, AI and machine learning techniques and algorithm, wired and wireless connectivity, augmented reality, virtual  reality,  mixed  reality,  and  digital  twins.  The  adoption  of  such  technologies  enables  smart manufacturing/factories.\n\nImportantly, the major beneficial outcome of  Smart Factory/Manufacturing and Industry  is that of increased  productivity  in  production;  measured  as  the  same  number  of  machines  producing  more output effectively lessening the embedded carbon in each unit of production. The benefit of increased productivity is recognised by leading bodies including the United Nations International Development Organisation (UNIDO) and the UK having adopted this in its Industrial decarbonisation Strategy [6], [7].\n\nAlthough  the  increase  in  this  overall  infrastructure  efficiency  could  dwarf  the  networking  energy efficiency  provided  by  C-PON,  C-PON  aims  to  achieve  this  carbon  reduction  by  being  a  potential fundamental enabler to smart manufacturing.\n\nAccording to the ' SMARTer2030 ICT Solutions for 21st Century Challenges ' Report, ICT will enable 20% reduction of the global carbon emission by cutting the need for 12.1 Gt CO2e by 2030 by enabling smart mobility, smart agriculture, smart energy and smart manufacturing [8].

Such  visibility  and transparency could be achieved via functions such as remote monitoring of product quality and manufacturing  processes.  Given  the  ability  to  collect  data  from  connected  assets,  augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, and digital twin technologies can be used to further improve visibility  and  transparency  of  manufacturing  operations  and  processes.  Such  technologies  can enable  seamless  action  on  insights  generated  from  data  analytics  and  the  application  of intelligence  derived  from  the  deploying  AI  and  machine  learning  algorithms.  For  example, intelligence derived from analytic and application of AI and machine learning to fault diagnosis (during AI-assisted monitoring) can be relayed to technicians using smart glasses with embedded AR  features  to  optimise  fault  diagnosis/troubleshooting  and  maintenance  and  repairs  on  the factory  floor  (AR-assisted  maintenance  and  repair).

Therefore, improving operational efficiency because down-time can be significantly reduced. Additionally, application of AI and ML algorithms enable fault/failure prediction in smart factory/manufacturing (i.e., AI-assisted predictive maintenance). Therefore, downtimes can be avoided via predictive maintenance triggers.\n- Cloud/Edge Computing: To support storage of collected data and subsequent analytics and the application of AI and ML algorithms, remote and/or in-situ processing capacity is required. The pay as you go service models of the cloud computing paradigm offers cost efficient means to support storage, analytics and AI and ML  features required in smart manufacturing. However, centralisation  of  such  capability  as  purposed  by  the  cloud  computing  paradigm  can  be disadvantageous for some smart manufacturing applications such as quality control and dynamic automation of the manufacturing process. Therefore, edge  computing is an  equally  important feature of the smart manufacturing since it extends the features of cloud computing paradigm to the network edges where smart factories are traditionally located.

The high bandwidth will also minimise the end-to-end latency experience by smart factory applications.\n- Reduced Latency: Relative to conventional DCNs, C-PON offers about 82% reduction in end-to-end latency. Therefore C-PON offers reduced total latency for computing and analytics applications that support smart factory applications. This is very useful for mission critical applications which have ultra-low  latency  performance  requirements.

Therefore,  enabling  a  reliable  and  resilient  platform  to  support applications that promote optimal operational efficiency in smart factories.\n- Low Cost: Relative to conventional DCNs, C-PON enables up to 43% reduction in CAPEX and 27% reduction in OPEX. Therefore, C-PON offers a cheap platform to support smart factory applications in cloud or edge processing locations.\n\nIn general, the C-PON platform is an enabler for commercial use cases because it provides computing capacity for the various applications that are associated with each use case and also provides a fabric to interconnect underlying compute components.\n\nThe C-PON platform offers 3 diverse fabric types. Each fabric type features different capability in terms of latency, resilience and power consumption. Therefore, the C-PON platform offers the flexibility of selecting an optimal fabric for a specific application based on performance/QoS requirements such as latency  and  power  consumption.  Furthermore,  the  programmability  of  the  C-PON  platform  allows adaptation of any C-PON fabric to suit application specific demands. Therefore, each fabric can be programmed to deliver specific QoS requirement as desired by applications that are selected to run on the  C-PON platform. Additionally, routing and load balancing of traffic over a C-PON fabric can be performed based on a predefined cost function.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where smart factory/manufacturing commercial use case is enabled by a private mobile network (PMN) that is implemented as a slice of the 5G network.

One way of achieving such capability is by prioritising DC network traffic based on each application's class and requirements. Class specification for packets can be performed based on 5 tuple components i.e., source and destination IP address, source and destination port and the protocol. Additionally, the lookup/match action engine of the forwarding plane can be configured to forward traffic in a predefined manner that leads to optimal performance for certain applications.",

The cost function can be computed based on different  weights.  Such  weights  can  be  defined  using  metrics  which  include  link  utilisation,  delay, bandwidth and other QoS requirements. The cost functions and their associated weights could inform path selection and forwarding table configuration on (the forwarding block of) each smart NIC in the C-PON platform.\n\nSuch cost function should be developed in collaboration with the commercial partners of ECOICE project based on the potential applications that are expected each commercial use case. C-PON is an enabler, which in the case of the MPN example used, provides the network operator the capability to devise billing/charging functionality according to network usage and the C-PON network architecture deployed. It should be noted that defining the usage of network by Mobile Network Operators (MNO) mobile is still in its infancy so this is an innovative area.\n\nFigure 20: Smart Manufacturing use case with C-PON platform.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, assets outside the hospital include the ambulances equipment and the monitoring devices provided for in-home patients. A smart healthcare system enables the collection of status from the assets and various sensors and provides centralised visual monitoring features in realtime to boost response to any loss or damage or change to required conditions.\n- Data Analytics and AI-assisted diagnosis : Data of patients in a smart healthcare system are saved locally to increase customer privacy. As such data could be big, a smart healthcare system would contain ''edge or fog'' computing units that can store patience data and perform various ML and AI  algorithms  to  get  insights  that  can  improve  the  healthcare  experience  for  providers,  and patients.  Also,  doctors  can  utilise  the  outputs  of  an  AI-assisted  diagnosis  enabled  by  this infrastructure to accelerate the request of lab or scans results for the confirmation of the diagnosis.\n- High  Speed  Private  Communications: To  reduce  the  delays  associated  with public  wireless connectivity including Wi-Fi and cellular communication technologies such as 3G and 4G, a smart healthcare system would use a Private Mobile Network (PMN). A PMN reduces the latency as its local  infrastructure  is  dedicated  for  the  healthcare  systems  and  services.  It  also  improves  the privacy  and  can  enable  additional  adaptive  features  and  resources  slicing.    5G  or  future technologies can be adopted to implement the PMN.\n- Advanced Remote Patient Monitoring and Remote Surgical Consultation :  A  smart  healthcare system ensures full integration between the public and its private networks. It also ensures lowlatency interfaces with the public networks which can serve remote patients while meeting the sensitive delay standards of healthcare required to save lives. This can also enable remote surgical consultation where a paramedic at an accident scene can perform complex life-saving operation",

    "text": "- Scalability:  C-PON  will  be  able  to  meet  the  dynamic  requirements  of  future  vehicular communication infrastructures and newly built roads by providing highly scalable platform.\n- Power/Energy  Efficient  Computing:  C-PON  enables 80%  reduction  of  power  consumed by computing  at  the  edge  or  cloud  DCs,  which  is  considered  a  vital  feature  in  this  use  case especially in network based vehicular communication as illustrated in Figure 23 .\n- An  important consideration  is  that  by  enabling  efficient  automation  of  traffic  controls  and flow you can decrease carbon emissions from traffic which make up around a third of all carbon emissions. The #SMARTer2030 ICT Solutions for 21st Century Challenges Report concludes that real-time traffic information, smart logistics, intelligent lighting and other ICT enabled solutions could  abate  3.6Gt  CO2e,  including  abatement  from  avoided  travel. In  terms  of  societal benefits, 16% of all domestic traffic-related CO2 emissions could be avoided, equal to 2% of all domestic CO2 emissions.\n- High  bandwidth:  The  high  bandwidth  in  C-PON  can  allows  efficient  communication  among vehicles and their surroundings in highly populated and dense areas.\n- Reduced Latency: The reduced latency of up to 82% in C-PON allows vehicles to take actions and make decisions that are very time sensitive.\n- Resilient and Reliable: The resilience and reliability of C-PON provides a more secure and safer infrastructure for vehicles in case of link failure due to its alternative routes.\n- Low Cost: C-PON offers up to 43% reduction in CAPEX and 27% reduction in OPEX , which can result in significant cost reduction in vastly deployed applications such as vehicular networks.\n\nFigure 23: Vehicular Communication C-PON Use Cases.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In summary:\n\n- We achieved the technical deliverable DT16 within WP3 which is the initial draft specification of the C-PON cell. We defined the required components to build a C-PON cell. We provided a detailed description of the C-PON cell physical structure and specified the required connectivity. We discussed the scalability options for C-PON platforms which are at the cell-level (i.e., scaling the C-PON cell) and at the platform-level where several C-PON cells are interconnected through a  central  Optical  Line  Manager  (OLM).  We furthermore  provided  detailed  specification  of a basic C-PON cell which represents an initial testbed for the C-PON platform. In addition, we developed an initial implementation of the basic C-PON cell using Mininet (a network emulator) and P4. This is beyond MS2.\n- We achieved the second commercial deliverable (i.e., DC2 Within WP6) which is the advanced specification of the first use case (with Vodafone or BT) on edge processing for applications.\n- We developed ideas with BT for five new potential use cases, which is beyond MS2.\n\nThis  ambitious  programme  will  directly  contribute  towards  UK  becoming  a  low-carbon  economy enabling data centre and network operators to manage their energy usage, reduce costs and reduce carbon emissions.  In this regard, it is of critical national importance.\n\nThis document forms a detailed report on the work undertaken on the C-PON platform of the ECOICE project from 1 st  January 2022 to 15 th  March 2022, focused on the one technical deliverable and one commercial deliverable of the project. The organisation of this report is as follows:\n\n- Section 1 is an introduction.\n- Section 2 discusses the technical deliverable on the initial draft specification of C-PON cell.\n- Section 3 details the technical implementation updates on the ECOICE project.\n- Section 4 discusses the commercial deliverable on advanced specification of the first use case (with Vodafone or BT) on edge processing for applications.\n- Section 5 discusses prospective use cases and deployments for C-PON with BT.",

    "text": "C-PON technology is a patented [1]-[5] hardware and software networking for connecting and enabling low latency and high-speed inter-rack communication within edge and cloud data centers (DCs) and to the outside world. The patented intra-rack and intra-rack designs of the C-PON technology use cellular passive,  low  cost,  reliable  optical  components  to  replace  conventional  electronic  access  and aggregation switches. Therefore, it provides an infrastructure with energy-efficient hardware-software architecture to optically connect servers and storage in a DC or across distributed locations.\n\nThe ECOICE project aims to transition the C-PON technology from implementation on a computing hardware  to  a  minimum  viable  product  (prototype)  of  the  C-PON  technology  that  can  be  further developed into a commercial product. Amongst other deliverables, the specification of the C-PON cell forms one of the technical deliverables of the ECOICE project (i.e., DT16 ).\n\nThe C-PON technology offers various platform choices that are suitable for distributed or centralized computing and telecommunication systems. In these platforms, the C-PON cell is the smallest modular unit that can function (be operated) alone. A C-PON cell is a collection of inter-connected racks in the C-PON technology. The C-PON cell comprises a PON fabric (created using a cocktail of optical devices) that interconnect servers in different racks within the C-PON cell. Each rack in the C-PON cell hosts several servers and has a backplane that interconnects servers within that rack.\n\nEach server in the C-PON cell has a programmable C-PON card which supports the implementation of the  networking  function,  specifically  packet  forwarding,  and  provides  two  network  interfaces  that connect the server to the PON fabric and the backplane within the rack. The C-PON platform comprises multiple C-PON cells that are interconnected by the optical line terminal (OLT) which is implemented as an optical line manager (OLM). The OLM is a shared component of the C-PON technology on which the control protocols of the platform are implemented. The OLM also connects the cells to external networks as illustrated in Figure 1 .\n\nIn what follows of this section of this report, we provide a detailed description of the components of the C-PON cell, the description of the physical architecture and the initial specification of a basic C-PON cell.\n\nFigure 1: A C-PON platform with several interconnected C-PON cells.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This architecture is protected through the four, granted C-PON patents.\n\nEach rack is connected directly to the OLM through one of its (𝑹) groups. This is illustrated in Figure 3 by the dashed connections. Each of the remaining (𝑹 - 𝟏) groups have a direct connection with one of the other racks in the C-PON cell or with the OLM. Hence, to connect all the rack pairs, a total of 𝑹(𝑹-𝟏) 𝟐 rack-to-rack connections is required in the C-PON cell. This is because the link between two rack is established using a bi-directional link. The solid rack-to-rack connections (links) in Figure 3 illustrates this. The total number of connections in a C-PON cell is given by 𝑹(𝑹+𝟏) 𝟐 . This is because in addition to the rack-to-rack connections required in the C-PON cell, 𝑹 dedicated bi-directional connections are required to connect all racks in the cell to the OLM.\n\nIt is important to note that the selection of the connections between the groups can be altered. To achieve a fully connected C-PON cell, all racks pairs must be connected, and all racks must be connected to the OLM. The choice of the connections between the groups and between a group in each rack and the OLM determines the physical topology of the C-PON cell.\n\nFigure 3 provides a generalised structure for the C-PON cell. In a C-PON cell, the number of groups in each rack is equal to the total number or racks ( 𝑹 ). We distinguish between groups in a C-PON cell by defining a unique group ID ( 𝑮𝒓.𝒈 ) with two indices for each group i.e., the first index (𝒓) of the group ID indicates the rack ID and the second index (𝒈) of the group ID indicates the index of the group within the rack. For instance, 𝑮𝟏,𝟑 is the ID of third group in the first rack in the C-PON cell and 𝑮𝟑.𝟒 is the ID\n\nof the fourth group in the third rack. As the number of groups is equivalent to the number of racks, 𝑮𝑹,𝑹 would be the last group in the C-PON cell.\n\nEach server has a server ID denoted as 𝑺𝒌 , where 𝒌 = 𝟏, 𝟐  … 𝑲 . The index of a server within a group in the C-PON cell is given by combining the server ID and the group ID as 𝑺𝒌𝑮𝒓.𝒈 .  For example, the servers in 𝑮𝟒.𝟑 are  labeled 𝑺𝟏𝑮𝟒.𝟑,  𝑺 𝟐 𝑮𝟒.𝟑 , … 𝑺𝑲𝑮𝟒.𝟑 .  This  generalised structure of the C-PON cell is easily extendable to accommodate cell-level scalability of the C-PON platform via the introduction of unique ID (i.e., Cell ID) for each cell in the C-PON platform.\n\nEach rack contains a backplane (that can be initially considered as a switch) which connects servers within that rack. As the total number of servers in each rack is equal to (𝑹𝑲) servers, the backplane (switch) should have (𝑹𝑲) bidirectional ports to connect the servers within a rack.\n\nFigure 3: The Structure of a 𝐶 - 𝑃𝑂𝑁 𝐾 𝑅 Cell with 𝑅 racks and 𝐾 servers per group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn each group, one of its servers acts as a relay for the remaining servers in that group.",

Thus, each rack would contain ( 𝑹 )  relay  servers.  If  the  non-relay servers  of  each  group  need to  communicate with servers in other racks or with the OLM, they should first send their traffic to the relay server through the backplane. Then, the relay server forwards their traffic to the next hop on the communication path. In contrast to the patented C-PON technology which relies solely on PON, as illustrated in Figure 2, the introduction of relay servers simplifies the traditional C-PON architecture by avoiding the optical power budget limitations that are associated with the broadcast of optical signals within each group of servers over the fully passive PON fabric. This is a refinement beyond the patent, that is introduced here for\n\nthe first time to simplify the implementation. A collection of these refinements will lead to a future, implementation focused patent. Likewise, direct connectivity between the relay servers and the OLM addresses similar limitations of the architecture in Figure 2 .\n\nA C-PON cell can be described as 𝑪 - 𝑷𝑶𝑵 𝑲 𝑹 to determine its physical structure (i.e., topology), where 𝑹 denotes the number of racks and denotes the number of groups in each rack, and 𝑲 denotes the number of servers per group in a rack.

    "text": "An advantage of the cell-level scalability is avoiding the additional control complexities required for inter-connecting multiple C-PON cells and furthermore localising more traffic within the cell which further  reduces  the  overall  structure  by  reducing  the  inter  cell  traffic  and  its  routing  demands. However, the disadvantages include the need to restructure the physical topology, which includes changing the number of servers in each group, the backplane, and the connections within the scaled C-PON  cell.  The  OLM  also  should  update  the  control  and  monitoring  operations  to  reflect  on  the architectural changes and to recalculate the forwarding tables. In addition, increasing 𝑲 would reduce the server share of the link capacity (in Gbps) and hence the value of the maximum throughput per server within a specific group due to the use of the relay server for inter-rack traffic.\n\nScaling the C-PON platform at the platform-level enables incremental upgrade for a C-PON platform via the addition of new cells. However, it requires the OLM to handle communication with servers in\n\nother C-PON cells through the central OLM, which will restrict the number of available paths between servers in different cells and hence can reduce the resilience of the C-PON platform.\n\nTherefore,  the  choice  of  a  particular  C-PON  cell  size  and  total  number  of  cells  depends  on  the applications to be supported, for example in terms of the number of servers that are needed to run each application. These servers may best be collocated in one C-PON cell to localise traffic, reduce complexity and increase energy efficiency by reducing the cross (inter-cell) traffic. The applications also dictate the total number of servers needed, in addition to the resilience and latency requirements.\n\nTherefore, in addition to the technical development (reported in Section 2), we have engaged in parallel in  commercial  use  case  development  (reported  in  Section  4)  to  guide  the  choice  of  the  best configuration of the C-PON cells, (in addition to guiding choices in NICs, OLM, backplane and software). It should be noted that a general purpose C-PON platform design is also possible, but its optimality may vary with applications.",

It provides an inexpensive real-time emulation for customised and complex network topologies. It uses standard Linux kernel and network applications for creating hosts, switches, links, and SDN controllers. Moreover, Mininet provides the flexibility to emulate the link bandwidth, the expected delay and NIC queue size. It has a command line interface (CLI) that is aware of the network topology, which is used in configuring, monitoring, running supported systemlevel  regression  tests  and  debugging  network  issues.  Therefore,  the  built  P4  programs  that  are successfully  deployed  on  Mininet  can  be  shipped  to  the  physical  network  components  with  minor changes/considerations  related  to  the  hardware  manufacturer's  design.

This  is  achieved  by installing 5G-enabled sensors throughout the factory. These sensors can be connected and controlled using  a  Mobile  Private  Network  (MPN),  which  provides  several  benefits  such  as  security,  remote control, low latency, and enhanced throughput. The data from these sensors are continuously collected and analysed to improve the automation process. Figure 1 shows a range of sensors used in a smart factory.\n\nFigure 16 Connected Sensors\n\n<!-- image -->",

    "text": "Ultracell Networks team held two meetings with Louise Krug (Head of Sustainability Research at BT). The first meeting held on 3 rd   February 2022 was to introduce BT to C-PON and ECOICE project progress, and to discuss specific areas of collaboration in use case development. The second meeting held on 7 th   March 2022 was to discuss some use cases suggested by Louise in the first meeting. An agreement was given that Ultracell Networks will hold its field trials for CPON at BT's test beds in Ipswich. The details of the use cases and field trial will be developed over the lifetime of ECOICE. The use cases suggested by Louise, where she thinks C-PON will have major impact are:\n\n- a. C-PON for edge processing to reduce IoT traffic in the wired core BT network: In this use case, there are potential applications in different areas such as healthcare, vehicular networking, logistics, manufacturing and education. Louise stated that in this use case machine learning will be considered for traffic analysis and optimisation.\n- b. Reduce electronic switching in BT exchanges (equivalent of about 5000 small/medium data centres) by using C-PON: In  this use case, with the prospects of the UK's PSTN network to switch off in 2025, BT is expecting 25 million sites to switch from copper to full fibre interconnections. Their expectations by 20302035 is that the UK's infrastructure will be fully interconnected using fibre. Louise thinks that there will be great  benefit  of  having  C-PON  at  the  forefront  of  this  transition,  where  the  BT  exchanges  will  be implemented  using  commodity  servers,  with  C-PON  being  the  optical  interconnection  technology  of servers.\n- c. C-PON for storing and processing video at the edge of the network: In this use case, C-PON can help in adopting  augmented  reality  in  several  applications  such  as  stadiums.  This  ties  with  BT  handling  large volumes of video and its interest in sport content. C-PON processing can enable multiple views of a sporting event on demand, processed and spliced as requested by the users, real time; with as many as 40k or more requests in a stadium. These however may not all be unique camera / scene splicing requests. Processing and AR / VR can also provide an interactive  platform  for  visitors  to  navigate  around  the  stadium,  find facilities,  have  access  to  entertainment  material  during  breaks,  display  match  information  and  have different angles of watching the game. This will not only provide entertainment for stadium visitors but also improve the quality of the service provided for them.\n- d. C-PON for energy saving in ORAN: In this use case network slicing will be used to map resources to services. The different RAN functions: Remote unit (RU), Distributed unit (DU) and Central unit (CU) will be taken into consideration, where RU handles the lower physical functions (PHY), DU handles the higher physical and transport functions (PHY, MAC, RLC) and CU handles the packet processing and quality of service (RRC, PDCP and SDAP).",

In general, C-PON will provide a processing platform that can be used to implement the CU and DU functions, as well as hosting and processing user content and facilitate running applications such as Virtual Networks Functions (VNFs). A key selling point here is the C-POn reduced power consumption and lower latency.\n\n- e. C-PON for deploying a flexible number of servers at the edge by joining C-PON cells, useful in ORAN and wider: In this use case, BT will be deploying a mixture of small cell and large-scale macro cells. Louise stated that  it  will  be  beneficial  to  have  C-PON  in  the  large-scale  macro  cells.  The  benefit  of  C-PON  in  such deployments, is that it can allow a smaller number of CPON conntected servers to be deployed at cell sites, with nearby cell sites providing added processing capacity on demand using the BT PONs which are already in the field to link the C-PON sites. This use case will also help tackle the challenges with latency and power consumptions.",

In summary:\n\n- We achieved the technical deliverable DT6 within WP4 which is the initial draft specification of the  C-PON  control  software.  We  specify  a  software  defined  networking  (SDN)  compatible management architecture for the C-PON platform.  We defined the C-PON control software and outlined the three critical elements of the C-PON control software which are the controller, network applications and the interfaces between the control software and C-PON card.  We furthermore provided a generic control protocol which leverage the critical elements on the control software in conjunction with the C-PON cards to achieve end-to-end communication in the  C-PON  platform.  We  also  review  candidate  controllers,  interfaces,  and  management protocols from the SDN paradigm that can support the realisation of C-PON control software. In  addition,  we  present  initial  simulation  of  C-PON  platform  using  an  open-source  SDN controller and an update on the emulation of the round-trip time (RTT) meter for the C-PON platform. This is beyond MS3 requirements.\n- We achieved the third commercial deliverable (i.e., DC3 Within WP6) which is the advanced specification of the first use case (with Vodafone or BT) on edge processing for applications. The work done in DC3 builds on the achievements of the previous commercial deliverables which scoped a range of possible use cases for the C-PON platform and gave advanced specification of some use cases.  This iteration of the commercial deliverable focuses on further interaction with partners (the High Value Manufacturing Catapult, Vodafone, and BT) of the ECOICE project to further develop commercial use cases of the C-PON platform.",

The patented intra-rack and intra-rack designs of the C-PON technology use cellular passive, low cost, reliable optical components to replace conventional electronic access and  aggregation  switches.  Therefore,  it  provides  an  infrastructure  with  energy-efficient  hardwaresoftware architecture to optically connect servers and storage in a DC or across distributed locations.\n\nThe  ECOICE  project  aims  to  transition  the  C-PON  technology  from  implementation  on  a computing hardware to a minimum viable product (prototype) of the C-PON technology that can be further developed into a commercial product. Amongst other deliverables, the  specification of the control software forms one of the technical deliverables of the ECOICE project (i.e., DT6).\n\nIn  contrast with legacy networks where both control plane and data plane components are embedded in every network device, the C-PON platform leverages the software defined networking (SDN) architecture.  Hence,  the  control  plane  of  the  C-PON  platform  is  centralised  into  the  control software which is decoupled from the data plane (C-PON cards) of the C-PON platform. The C-PON control software dynamically governs how communication is performed within the C-PON platform by computing and installing forwarding information onto the C-PON cards and monitoring the state of the underlying network.\n\nIn this section of this report, we provide a brief description of the legacy network management architecture and describe how the novel SDN management architecture is leveraged for the C-PON platform. Then, a detailed description of the C-PON control software and its associated elements is given. Using CPON's management architecture, a generic control protocol for dynamic communication",

The control plane is logically centralised  into  the  control  software  that  act  as  the  controller.  Relative  to  the  traditional  network management  architecture,  the  SDN  paradigm  improves  network  management  architecture  in  the following ways:\n\n1. Decouples  network  control  plane  from  data  plane,  and  hence  data  plane  functions  can  be deployed  on  high  speed  and  simplified  network  devices  that  are  optimised  for  packet forwarding tasks.\n2. Forwarding of network packets based on destination IP is replaced with  flow-based  packet forwarding where packet forwarding decisions are based on any (or group of) packet header field value(s) in the transport, network, or link layer header.\n3. Reduces  complexity  through  centralising  network  automation  in  response  to  network  or dynamic flow patterns change.\n4. Increases  network  reliability  by  eliminating/reducing  manually  configuration  of  network devices.\n\nThese  benefits  of  the  SDN  paradigm  are  leveraged  in  the  design  of  the  C-PON  platform  to achieve optimal performance. The architectural approach of SDN is particularly adopted in the design of the C-PON control software.  Similar to the architectural approach of SDN paradigm, the control plane and data plane are decoupled in the C-PON platform as illustrated in Figure 2 Control plane functionalities  reside  in  the  logically  centralised  control  software  along  with  management  plane functions.

The controller maintains a global view of the C-PON network by collecting latest network statistics and other information about that state of links and C-PON cards in the C-PON fabric.

Therefore,  a  design  approach  that  supports  the development and deployment of new network applications  is  recommended for  C-PON control  software.  However,  the  routing  application  has  been  identified  as  an  essential application needed to achieve end-to-end communication in the C-PON platform. A brief overview of some network applications is as follows:\n\n- a. Routing application : The routing application is an application to determine end-to-end paths to be followed between data plane devices in the C-PON platform. This can be achieved by running an instance of a routing algorithm such as Dijkstra algorithm or Bellman-Ford  algorithm  based  on  the  most  recent  link  and  node  state  information received from the controller.\n- b.

Conversely, this application determines the (groups of) packets that would be discarded by the data plane devices.\n- c. MAC learning application : Is an application that implements a process of learning the MAC address of all data plane devices in the C-PON platform.\n- d.

However,  this  is  sufficient  to  enable demonstrate end-to-end communication in the C-PON platform.\n\nGiven the physical connectivity within the C-PON platform, the control protocol as illustrated in Fig. 4 operates as follows:\n\n- Step  1 :  The  controller  and  network  devices  of  the  C-PON  platform  are  bootstrapped  and configured. Additionally, the resilient in-band control channels to support control information exchange can be setup. The features and functions of this step are associated with control and management applications/protocols of the control software.\n- Step 2 : Compute end-to-end routes for required data paths using a routing application. Endto-end route computation may consider defined, load balancing, resilience, and other traffic engineering policies prior to the computation of forwarding information. The functions in this step are performed by the routing application in the control software.\n- Step 3 :  Update forwarding information on each data plane device in the C-PON platform to implement  optimal  end-to-end  routing  of  network  traffic.  The  functions  of  this  steps  are performed by the controller in control software over the interfaces that connect the control software to the data plane of the C-PON platform.\n- Step 4 : Each packet is forwarded by the data plane devices to the next hop on C-PON fabric based  on  installed  forwarding  information  until  it  reaches  the  intended  destination.  In  the process of forwarding, data plane devices should also update the packet metadata as required. Furthermore, the data planes devices should also collect relevant statistics needed for optimal performance and to maintain accurate global view of the network. The functions in this step are associated with the data plane of the C-PON platform.\n- Step 5 :  Each data plane device in the C-PON platform periodically reports the network state (device/link state and utilisation) via established control channel to the control software. These are functions that should be coordinated by the controller and by protocols that are supported by the control software.\n- Step 6: Based on information received or not received from distributed data plane devices in the C-PON platform, the control software determines if a change in network state has occurred.\n- o If network state changed : return to Step 2",

OpenFlow :  OpenFlow  is  the  most  widely  known  open  API  that  provides  a  common specification for the communication channel between the separated control plane and data plane in SDN architecture. However, OpenFlow was designed for a specific set of common use cases and assumed the forwarding elements have a fixed, well-known behaviour, which makes it harder to extend and add new features. More recently, the P4 language, a data plane language the enables greater programmability of data plane networks compared to OpenFlow, has been proposed.\n- ii. Protocol-Oblivious  Forwarding  (POF) :  POF  was  introduced  to  enhance  the  network programmability. In contrast to OpenFlow which defines the flow tables according to the existing network protocols, POF dynamically programs the forwarding plane to support new protocols.\n- iii. P4  Runtime :  P4  Runtime  is  an  API  designed  to  control  any  data  plane  devices  whose behaviour defined by P4 language. It provides flexibility to add features over time while using  the  same  API.  Additionally,  P4  Runtime  can  be  used  to  emulate  the  behaviour  of OpenFlow and to extend its functionalities.\n\nPreviously, P4 language was proposed to define the C-PON cards pipeline i.e., fields to match upon, actions to be performed on the packets and the order to perform matches and actions. Given the adoption of the P4 programmable Xilinx smart NIC as the development platform for the C-PON card, adoption of the P4 Runtime API is more appealing. However, should a different interface be required in the future based on unique needs, new bespoke interface will be developed, as necessary.\n\nCandidates Control Software: Since the emergence of the SDN paradigm a range of proprietary and open-source network operating systems (NOS) and controllers have been developed to leverage the benefits of the SDN architecture. Examples of open source SDN controllers include NOX, OpenDaylight and ONOS. It is important to note that proprietary controllers, such as HPE virtual application networks (VAN) SDN controller, are also an option. However, the ECOICE project intends to give priority to opensource SDN controllers over proprietary controllers such as:",

OpenDaylight :  OpenDaylight  is  an  open-source  SDN  controller  that  adopts  a  modular architecture for application development. It is a collaborative project that is manged by the Linux Foundation. OpenDaylight architecture comprises application and control layers and plugins (and protocols) that enable communication between these two layers and to the network  devices  that  are  being  controlled.  Amongst  others,  OpenDaylight  supports OpenFlow and OVSDB as plug-ins between OpenDaylight platform and network devices.\n- iii. ONOS :  ONOS  is  a  scalable  and  distributed  open-source  control  platform  for  the  SDN paradigm which features an intent framework. ONOS is also part of the Linux Foundation. ONOS SDN controller offers several choices of interfaces to communicate with underlying network devices. For example, ONOS supports both OpenFlow and P4 Runtime amongst other next generation SDN interfaces. The adoption of a P4 programmable data plane in the C-PON platform makes ONOS an appealing candidate for the development of the C-PON platform.\n\nIn addition to control plane functions, the control software is expected to perform the management plane  functions  (i.e.,  configuring  and  managing  networking  devices)  in  the  C-PON  platform.  Some candidate protocols that can be leveraged to implement network configuration and management in control software include:\n\n- i. Simple  Network  Management  protocol  (SNMP ):  SNMP  is  a  common  protocol  used  to monitor and manage network devices. It relies on management information bases (MIBs) to define the collected information and how to change and configure the devices. Although SNMP is widely used, it has drawbacks that limit its ability to configure network devices in an  automated  way.  Therefore,  SNMP  is  used  for  monitoring  purposes  rather  than configuration.",

Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF): Recently, NETCONF emerged as a configuration management protocol. It was proposed to address the limitations of SNMP by bringing out capabilities that enable network automation. NETCONF provides an efficient mechanism to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of the network devices. It uses YANG, a data modelling language to model configuration and state data.",

Our technical team have prepared a presentation for Ian to start internal discussions. The presentation covers the overview and benefits of C-PON technology with focus on the smart manufacturing use case.\n\nFactory of the future vision was built based on identifying potential collaborators and how they can contribute to certain elements of the use case as shown in Figure 23. These collaborators will work on  different  aspects  such  as  real-time  production  lines  customisation,  Blockchain  for  enterprise resource  planning  and  supply  chain  management,  Cobots  communication  and  predictive  machine analytics for services such as maintenance and production.

The NZIP Accelerator Consortia includes the High Value Manufacturing Catapult (HVMC).

They are likely to  be  better  placed  than  the  Manufacturers  to  provide  feedback  on  potential  needs  for  and benefits  of  C-PON  because  they  are  much  closer to the data switching infrastructure. Manufacturing 'end -users' increasingly buying -in automation services as well as the related data processing and communications services.\n- Two of the key benefits of C-PON (energy efficiency, low latency) will interest very different parts of  a  manufacturing  operation.    Energy  savings  need  to  be  sold  to  Operational  Managers (responsible  for  Sustainability  and  Energy)  and  may  be  of  relatively  low  interest  to  Production Engineers. Low latency is of most interest to production engineers.  This will complicate the sales process unless one benefit is sufficiently compelling to one group in the organisation.  Service",

    "text": "Ultracell  Networks  Ltd  has  prepared  this  document  for  BEIS  as  evidentiary  information  of achievement of key milestones and objectives relating to the deliverables of the third quarter of 2022 for  the  Cellular  Passive  Optical  Networks  (C-PON)  platform  of  the  Energy-efficient  Cellular  Optical Interconnects for Clouds and Edge-processing (ECOICE) project.\n\nWe are confident that we have understood and met the objectives and are providing a high quality, value-based report that meets the requirements as defined in the project. In summary:\n\n- We achieved the technical deliverable DT5 within WP2 which is the advanced specification of optical line manager (OLM) to be implemented on FPGA. We gave an overview of a generic OLM for the C-PON platform by defining the functions performed by the OLM and by describing the physical  architecture  of  the  OLM.  Thereafter,  we  gave  the  technical  specification  of  the components and sub-components of the OLM. We provided a detailed specification of the OLM for a C-PON testbed that will be implemented during the ECOICE project. We discussed the options for establishing a control and data paths through the proposed C-PON Testbed.\n- We achieved the seventh technical deliverable (i.e., DT7 within WP5) which is the advanced specification  of  C-PON  optical  backplane.  We  provided  a  brief  overview  of  the  backplane covering  the  functions  it  offers  within  the  C-PON  platform.  We  reviewed  the  options  for implementing the C-PON optical backplane and settled for optical circuit switch (OCS) as the most feasible option. We outlined and reviewed a range of deployment options for OCSs in the C-PON platform and evaluated the performance of each option. We decided on which option to implement based on the output of a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optmisation model. Finally, we discussed connection management for OCS-based optical backplane for CPON.\n\nThis  document forms a detailed report on  the work undertaken on the C-PON platform of the ECOICE project from 1 st July 2022 to 28 th  September 2022, focused on the two technical deliverables as well as progress on commercial engagements in the project. The organisation of this report is as follows:\n\n- Section 1 is an introduction.\n- Section  2 discusses  the  technical  deliverable  on  the  advanced  specification  of  OLM  to  be implemented on FPGA.\n- Section 3 details the advanced specification of C-PON optical backplane.\n- Section 4 details technical implementation updates in the ECOICE project.\n- Section 5 discusses updates on commercial engagements in the ECOICE project.",

    "text": "C-PON technology is a patented hardware and software networking technology for connecting and enabling low latency and high-speed inter-rack communication within edge and cloud data centers (DCs) while also providing connectivity to the outside world. The patented intra-rack and inter-rack designs of the C-PON technology use cellular passive, low cost, reliable optical components to replace conventional electronic access and aggregation switches. Therefore, it provides an infrastructure with energy-efficient hardware-software architecture to optically connect servers and storage in a DC or across distributed locations.\n\nThe  ECOICE  project  aims  to  transition  the  C-PON  technology  from  implementation  on  a computing hardware to a minimum viable product (prototype) of the C-PON technology that can be further developed into a commercial product. Amongst other deliverables, the specification of optical line manager (OLM) to be implemented on FPGA forms one of the technical deliverables of the ECOICE project (i.e., DT5).\n\nThe OLM is a physical hardware that facilitates communications within the C-PON platform and between the C-PON platform and external systems by performing a range of essential functions. These functions  are  enabled  by  the  physical  components  of  each  OLM  such as  C-PON  cards,  backplanes, computing hardware and auxiliary components.\n\nIn  subsequent  subsections  of  this  section,  we  give  an  overview  of  the  OLM  and  its  physical architecture  as  well  as  provide  the  technical  specification  of  the  OLM.

A high-level description of these functions is given as follows:\n\n- i. Physical Functions : These functions enable physical connectivity to and from the OLM. These comprise features that enable physical connectivity and media access control (MAC) in the CPON platform.\n- ii. Packet Forwarding Functions : The packet forwarding functions of the OLM comprise data plane functions that enable packet forwarding. These functions support end-to-end communication within/to/from the C-PON platform. Packet forwarding functions focus on enabling transfer of packets through the OLM.\n- iii. Logical Functions : The logical functions of the OLM comprise control plane and management plane functions which provide the intelligence that dictates how end-to-end communication is performed over physical connectivity in the C-PON platform. The logical functions of the OLM are  predominantly enabled by the  control  software that  is  hosted  in  the  OLM.  The  control software governs how communication is performed in the C-PON platform by using a range of algorithms, protocols and applications that perform logical functions of the OLM. Such logical functions provided by the OLM include routing; intelligence and control to coordinate the cells and to interface cells to the external systems; network traffic load balancing capability over network fabric of the C-PON platform; and configuration of additional routing paths through the OLM for resilience.\n\nThe specification of the physical architecture of the OLM and how this physical architecture enables physical functions and packet forwarding functions of the OLM is the subject of study in this section of the report.

    "text": "The OLM chassis hosts several physical components as illustrated in Fig. 1; these components implement the physical functions and packet forwarding functions of the OLM and provide necessary computing capacity to support the control software which implements the logical functions of the OLM. At  a  high-level,  the  primary  physical  components  of  the  OLM  include  C-PON  cards,  backplane, computing hardware and auxiliary components.\n\nC-PON Cards: The C-PON cards that are positioned in the OLM perform a range of functions which include the following:\n\n- i. Interfacing with physical media to receive and transmit bitstreams.\n- ii. Parsing  of  packets  and  using  the  content  of  the  packet  header  to  make  decisions  about forwarding, queuing, and/or discarding during period of link congestion.\n\n- iii. Storing packets during processing and queuing. This is enabled by the memory buffer of the CPON card.\n- iv. Forwarding of packets to the host of the C-PON card, to ports on the same C-PON card and/or to other C-PON cards as required.\n\nConsequently,  the  C-PON  cards  comprise  a  range  of  physical  sub-components  i.e.,  network interfaces, forwarding engines, buffers, traffic managers as illustrated in Fig. 1. Detailed discussion on the sub-components of the C-PON card are given later in this report.\n\nFigure 1: Physical Architecture of the Optical Line Manager.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBackplane: The backplane of the OLM provides connectivity between distinct C-PON cards in the OLM. This ensures that the packets arriving at any interface of a C-PON card in the OLM can be transferred to any interface of another C-PON card in the OLM.\n\nComputing  Hardware: The  computing  hardware  of  the  OLM  provides  general  purpose  computing capacity i.e., CPU, memory and storage needed to support instances of the C-PON control software. The control software provides logical functions to the C-PON platforms which generally include control plane and management plane functions. The control software configures and manages the distributed C-PON cards in the C-PON platform.\n\nAuxiliary  Components: The  OLM  also  requires  auxiliary  components  which  support  its  operations. Examples  of  such  auxiliary  components  include  power  supply  systems  and  cooling  systems.  Such auxiliary systems can be deployed in a redundant manner to improve the OLM's resilience. Additionally, auxiliary components can include a dedicated component that performs the management of cooling and power systems as well as other internal management functions within OLM.

    "text": "The C-PON cards comprise a range of physical sub-components which include network interfaces, forwarding  engines,  buffers  and  traffic  managers  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  These  sub-components systematically enable the previously outlined functions of the C-PON cards. Hence, detailed discussion on each sub-component of the C-PON card is important and is given as follows:\n\n- i. Network  interfaces :  Network  interfaces  are  integrated  into  C-PON  cards.  These  interfaces provide physical layer interfaces and media access control (MAC) on the OLM. Hence, network interfaces  comprise  Ethernet  ports  and  Peripheral  Component  Interconnect  Express  (PCIe) interfaces that provide connectivity to physical links. The Ethernet ports terminate physical links from servers in the C-PON platform or from gateway routers. On the other hand, PCIe interfaces terminate PCIe lanes to the host of each C-PON card. Ethernet interfaces receive packet frames from the physical links and transmit packet frames as bitstreams over electrical or optical links in compliance with IEEE 802.3 standard. In contrast, PCIe interfaces receive packet frame from physical links and transmit packets over electrical links in compliance with PCIe standard.\n- ii. Forwarding  engine: A  forwarding  engine  determines  the  output  C-PON  card(s)  and/or  the corresponding interface(s)  to  which  a  packet  would  be  forwarded  by  performing  necessary lookups. Such lookups use the forwarding information installed by the control software. A CPON card can have one or more forwarding engine instances. On the one hand, the forwarding engines in each C-PON card can be designed to perform only minimal tasks needed to transfer packets between the C-PON cards in the OLM. On the other hand, the forwarding engine can also be designed to perform complex functions such as traffic classification and prioritization. Furthermore, forwarding between interfaces in the same C-PON card can be performed locally on that C-PON card by directing the packet to the corresponding output interface. In contrast, forwarding across interfaces connected to different C-PON cards must be performed via the backplane. Each forwarding engine may implement both ingress and egress packet forwarding pipelines for packets that arrive and are destined to the interfaces serviced by the forwarding engine. Forwarding is performed at line rate; hence, it can be performed in a custom hardware such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). However, during the development phase, programmable Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can be adopted in the place of ASIC.\n- iii. Buffers: Buffers  enable  the  C-PON  card  to  temporarily  store  the  packet  payload  while  the forwarding engine is performing lookups. The buffers in the C-PON card also temporarily store packets when the output link from the OLM is not idle. When the buffer is full, packets can be dropped in a coordinated manner. Buffers can be implemented as on-chip memory in the SoC and/or in an external memory. Usually, on-chip memory or buffer is relatively smaller compared to external memory but faster.\n- iv.",

Additionally,  the  traffic  manager  can  also support traffic policing and shaping based on predefined Quality of service (QoS) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The traffic manager can also support admission control of packet into\n\nbuffers.

    "text": "The backplane interconnects distinct C-PON cards in the same OLM. In an OLM with multiple CPON cards, a switched backplane with equal number of input and output ports can be adopted to interconnect  such  C-PON  cards.  This  is  because  a  switched  backplane  offers  high  bandwidth  since concurrent communication between multiple C-PON cards is possible. Alternatively, a proportionally sized  backplane  can  be  adopted  for  the  OLM  when  few  C-PON  cards  are  installed  in  it.  It  is  also important to note that an OLM can deploy redundant backplanes to improve capacity and resilience. Redundant  backplanes  help  to  withstand  failures  and  avoid  single  point  of  failure.  Additionally, redundant backplanes can also reduce delay when used to transfer a large frame in parallel. However, despite high bandwidth offered by a switched backplane, contention is a probable issue when the OLM adopts a switched backplane. Therefore, within each timeslot, a scheduling mechanism is needed to determine the input port that is permitted to transmit to a given output port via the backplane.",

    "text": "In the illustration in Fig. 2, the C-PON cards of the OLM are implemented using Xilinx SmartNIC which provides some functions of network interfaces, forwarding engine, buffer, and traffic manager.\n\n- i. Network Interfaces : The Xilinx SmartNIC supports the Ethernet standards along with support for direct-attach copper and optical cables. Additionally, the Xilinx SmartNIC also possess a PCIe interface with which they interface with the x86 server. Virtual interfaces between applications running on the x86 server and the C-PON cards are also implemented via direct memory access over PCIe.\n- ii. Forwarding Engine : The Xilinx SmartNIC supports a range of traffic engineering features which include packet parsing and filtering. These features are performed by the integrated streaming processor of the Xilinx SmartNIC platform. The Xilinx SmartNIC also supports implementation of one or more instances of the forwarding engine for the C-PON testbed by providing a suitable environment to develop, host and support custom packet processors called plugins. Plugins are additional packet processors that can be written in P4, RTL or HLS. Such plugins are developed to  run  at  line  rate  on  the  FPGA  of  the  programmable  Xilinx  SmartNIC  to  provide  new functionalities i.e., to support additional features and new protocols. The FPGA of the Xilinx\n\nSmartNIC is a relatively close substitute for implementing forwarding engine in a custom ASIC as expected in a commercial C-PON platform. In the C-PON testbed, the forwarding engine of each C-PON card can be designed to support additional functions (such as packet classification, access  control  list  processing  and  policing)  as  needed.  This  is  achieved  by  developing  new plugins which perform the required functions. Additionally, Xilinx SmartNIC supports routing of network traffic to appropriate interfaces (physical or virtual) and as well as the replication of packets.  Replication  of  packets  will  enable  multicasting  and  broadcasting  of  packets  as necessary. Based on the outlined functions and features of the Xilinx SmartNIC, the forwarding engine on C-PON cards in the OLM is designed to perform the following functions outlined below. These outlined functions are realised via a custom plugin that is written with the P4 language.\n\n- a. Parsing :  This  involves  receiving  packets  from  interfaces  of  the  C-PON  card  (after conversion  from  bitstream  to  frames)  and  separating  the  packet  header  from  the payload. Subsequently, the information needed to perform the packet forwarding is extracted from the header. Extracted information could include source and destination MAC address, EtherType, source, and destination IP addresses and TCP/IP protocol.\n- b. Lookups : The forwarding engine performs both layer 3 and layer 2 lookups to determine where the received packet should go to (in accordance with the information extracted from the header.",

Such decision can direct packets to any of the local interfaces of the CPON card which include the transmitter of the input  interface  or  the  transmitter  of another interface or to transmitting lanes of the PCIe bus which lead to the computing hardware of the OLM.\n- c. Packet Modification : Packet header updates/modifications such as updating the nexthop  destination  MAC  address  are  performed  based  on  packet  header  rewrite instructions associated with each successful lookup.\n- d. Deparsing :  The  (new) header is combined with the stored payload and the resulting packet is validated and subsequently streamed to the output interface.\n- iii. Buffers : The Xilinx SmartNIC provides IP (intellectual property) blocks to support plugins that are developed to implement the features and functions of the forwarding engine. This IP blocks provide buffers to store packet when the parsed packet headers are being processed by plugins of the forwarding engine. For example, during lookups in the forwarding engine, the payload is stored/buffered. Additionally, IP blocks provided in the Xilinx SmartNIC also support ingress and egress buffering for plugins when packets arrive faster than they can be processed and when an egress interface is slower compared to how quickly packets are processed respectively.\n- iv. Traffic manager : Xilinx SmartNIC IP blocks also support scheduling of packets to prevent head of line blocking in the packet data path and to implement QoS for some sources.

Each Xilinx SmartNIC also provides an integrated Arm system on-chip (SoC) (i.e., an on-board CPU) which offers additional computing hardware that can host an instance of the control software in a similar way as the x86 server. Alternatively, the computing capacity of the Arm SoC of the SmartNIC could be dedicated for hosting control plane agents of the control software. Such control plane agent of the control software is a custom control application that can facilitate updates of data plane tables in each C-PON card in the OLM.",

However, some inherent features of the Xilinx SmartNIC make setting up in-band control  channels  the  better  option  for  the  C-PON  testbed.  Xilinx  SmartNIC  supports  a  NIC  routing function which enables the SmartNIC to direct in-band control plane packets to a CPU on the x86 server (on which a Xilinx SmartNIC is installed) or to CPU on the Arm SoC on Xilinx SmartNIC.

Based on the used components, there are two types of OPS:\n\n- A broadcast-and-select switch where the OPS is composed of three layers: Wavelength encoder, space switch, and the wavelength selector. Each of the input fibres contains one wavelength. A splitter  per  input  fibre,  splits  the  signal  into  multiple  optical  gates  which  selects,  or  blocks packets as needed while ensuring correct timings and correct output fibre for each packet.\n\n- An AWG-based switch: AWGs are used for switching instead of the optical gates used in the broadcast and select OPSs. They are composed of three layers: input wavelength converter, AWG element, and output wavelength converter. In AWG-based OPSs, input and output fibres can carry multiple wavelengths. For the input stage, the signal per port is first demultiplexed and then, tuneable wavelength converters ensures that only one selected wavelength is passed per packet at its time slot to the AWG. The AWG, then routes the packet to the destinated output port and a fixed wavelength converter is used afterward at a specific wavelength per AWG output port, and a multiplexer then, provides the final WDM output.\n\nOPSs are used widely in optical core networks and have been proposed for usage in data centres. However, OPSs have the following challenges:\n\n- Lack  of  efficient  optical  buffering  and  optical  random-access  memory  (RAM)  memories  as optical delay lines are bulky and provide limited buffering duration and capacity which can be in few packets.\n- Expensive wavelength converters and complex control of the high number of the converters.",

In MEMS-based OCSs, several mirrors or reflectors are tilted to direct the beams to desired output port with typical reconfiguration time in the scale of ms or µs.  Due to their simple structure and energy efficiency, MEMS-based OCSs have been proposed for data centres. Among the shortcomings of MEMS are the relatively slow switching time that can lead to contentions.

Consequently, diverse pathways exist between servers within the same rack as well  as  between  servers  in  different  racks.  The  number  of  switches  also  contributes  to  the  power consumption of each option. It is important to highlight that each rack is assumed to have the same configuration and number of servers.

However, the switches are connected in a different physical architecture from the prior option (i.e., option A).

Additionally,  each rack has a single OCS  which  exclusively provides interconnectivity between the relay servers in the same rack. The main advantage of this option is the direct connection between the relay servers via a dedicated OCS which can lead to better performance in cases where relay servers are directly communicating with each other. However, a drawback of this option is the need for a standard server to send all its traffic through a relay server when it intends to send the traffic to any other server in other group or rack.  Moreover, each relay server requires a CPON card that has three ports to achieve the described connectivity. A summary of the requirements for this option in a single rack is given as follows.\n\nThe required number of switches and ports to implement this option for each rack can be summarised as follows.\n\n- Total number of OCS in groups = Number of groups.\n- Number of dedicated OCS that interconnects relay servers = 1.\n- Number of ports in intra-group OCS = Number of servers in one group.\n\n- Number of ports  in  dedicated  OCS  that  interconnects  relay  servers  =  Number  of  the  relay servers = Number of groups in the rack.\n\nFigure 8: Option B, Intra-Group and Relay Servers Inter-connections.\n\n<!-- image -->",

    "text": "This option relies on the clos network to connect all the servers in each rack. In electronic switching, a generic clos network is often adopted to reduce the number of cross-points required in electronic switches when electronic switching is considered by using a number of smaller crossbar switches. A clos  network  provides  non-blocking  communication between the input and the output ports using multistage switches. In this option, a similar multistage architecture which adopts OCS is proposed to implement a non-blocking backplane for each rack in the C-PON platform. A possible disadvantage of this  option  is  the  need  for  many  switches  which  consequently  increases  the  power  consumption. However, it is important to note that commercial OCS consume significantly lower power compared to electrical switches. Fig. 10 gives an example of a three-stage clos network (i.e., a total number of nine switches) that connects six servers in a rack. It is important to mention that the number of switches in each stage can increase based on the number of input and output ports. The three stages include the first stage switches, the second stage switches, and the third stage switches are described as follows:\n\n- a. The first  stage  switches  (i.e.,  the  input  switches):  This  includes  the  OCSs  which  are  directly connected to the servers. The required number of input OCSs depends on the number of servers in each rack. The number of input ports is equivalent to the number of servers in each rack. In the considered scenario, the input port of two input stage OCSs is connected to the transmitter of all servers in the two groups of each rack. The number of output ports of each input stage OCS depends on the number of second stage OCSs in the three-stage clos network.\n\n- b. The second stage OCSs (i.e., the middle stage): This stage provides connectivity between the input stage OCSs and the output stage OCSs. Providing a non-blocking communication requires that any idle input port must be allowed to reach an idle output port. A three-stage clos network ensures non- blocking communication by providing a specific number of middle stage OCSs. This number depends on ratio of total number of input ports connected to the clos network to the number of input port on each input stage OCS.  In this scenario, three second (middle) stage OCSs are utilized. On the one hand, the number of input ports of each second stage OCS is equal to the number of input stage OCSs. On the other hand, the number of output ports of a second stage OCS is equal to the number of output (third) stage OCSs.\n- c. The third stage (i.e., the output OCSs): This is the final stage of the clos network. The output port of the third stage OCSs connects to the receiver of each server in the rack. In this stage, the number of third stage OCSs is equal to the number of first stage OCSs. However, the number of input ports of each third stage OCS is determined by the number of middle stages OCSs which is three in this case. Consequently, (3x2) third stage OCSs are adopted in the illustrated example in Fig. 10.\n\nFigure 10: Option D: Clos Network.\n\n<!-- image -->",

    "text": "A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was developed to evaluate the performance of the  proposed  options.  The  objective  of  the  MILP  model  is  to  minimize  the  time  slots  required  for communication. Timeslot is an important metric when OCSs are deployed because they provide a\n\nmechanism to overcome contention. Contention occurs in a situation where a transmitting source cannot send traffic to the receiver of an intended destination because the receiver is configured to receive from a different transmitter at that given moment. Additionally, we also compare the options in terms of the total power consumption resulting from the communication between the servers. It is important to mention that the total power consumption is calculated based on the sum of the power consumption of all activated OCSs.   An evaluation scenario where each active OCS consumes a fixed power is adopted in all cases. Based on the outcome of the MILP models from the evaluation scenario, we  select  the  best  option  for  the  C-PON  platform  i.e.,  say  that  the  observed  results  (i.e.,  power consumption and timeslot count) state that this is the best of all options considered. All four backplane options are evaluated under the following (three) types of traffic:\n\n- Intra-cell  communication  (cell  level): This  traffic  type  implements  all-to-all  communication within the cell. In other words, each server in the cell has a request to every other server in that cell (expect itself).\n- Intra-rack communication (rack level): This type of traffic implements all-to-all communication within each rack. In other words, each server in each rack has a request to every other server in that rack (expect itself). Hence, traffic exchange between servers is localised within each rack in the C-PON platform.\n- Intra-group communication (group level): This  traffic  type  implies  that  each  server  in  each group within a rack has a request to every other server in that group (expect itself). Hence, traffic exchange is localised within each group in the C-PON platform.",

    "text": "The results in Fig. 11 show that all options require the same number of timeslots for completing the transmission of all the received traffic requests when communication is required at the group level. However, when all-to-all communication required at cell level, the option that adopted a single switch within the rack, and the clos network (i.e., options C and D) perform better than options A and B. This is because the OCSs in options A and B become bottlenecks (i.e., they are contended) when the servers in the same the group wish to communicate with servers in other groups of the same rack concurrently. A  similar  observation  is  made  all-to-all  communication  is  required  at  rack  level  (i.e.,  intra-rack communication). Hence, the servers in the same group must take turns to communicate with severs in other groups of the same rack.\n\nFigure 11: Delay measured in number of used timeslots\n\n<!-- image -->",

    "text": "The comparison of the power consumption is solely based on the number of switches activated to provision the demands under each deployment option. The power consumption of each switch is assumed to be 100 watts. As expected, the results in Fig. 12 indicates that option C is the most efficient option. This is because fewer active switches required under option C. Moreover, the results are also expectedly  shows  that  backplane  options  A  and  B  have  similar  performance  in  term  of  power consumption because of having the same number of switches. Furthermore, Fig. 12 shows that the clos network gives the worst performance in terms of power consumption as a high number of switches is required. Additionally, in the group level communication a single layer of However, it is important to note that commercial OCSs consume significantly lesser power compared to electrical switches.\n\nIn conclusion, a single switch option (i.e., option C) performed better in terms of both delay and power consumption, and hence it is preferred option that will be considered for the implementation of the C-PON platform.\n\nFigure 12: Power consumption measured based on number of active OCS.\n\n<!-- image -->",

    "text": "Given the fact that the optical switches are reconfigurable, the problem of how to find their optimal configuration under a given traffic scenario is inevitable. More importantly, the solution to the problem must provide optimal reconfiguration policies in the presence of traffic load changes. Furthermore, a high possibility of contention occurs in some cases if many servers need to communicate with the same server at the same time. Therefore, it is important to consider a scheduling algorithm to maintain the scheduling to facilitate fair access among the servers. Consequently, the configuration of the switch needs  to  be  adjusted  over  a  range  of  timeslots  using  the  scheduling  algorithm  to  ensure  that  all demands are eventually satisfied. In each time slot, the scheduling algorithm sets the states of the optical switches (i.e., the connection path between the input and output ports) based on the demands at  the  input  ports.  This  may  require  the  existing  connections  from  the  previous  timeslot  to  be rearranged to create new communication path between new pairs of input and output ports. The scheduling algorithm is described in three phases:\n\n- Request phase: In this phase, the server initiates a request to access another server (output port) through the input port. Each output port maintains a virtual queue to track the requests.\n- Grant phase: In this phase, the transmitting server is given the permit to start the connection with the receiving server. In other words, the connection path is set up between the input and the output port.\n- Transmit phase: In this phase, the actual transmission of the traffic takes place.\n\nA key parameter of the reconfiguration process is the traffic load between the servers which largely depends on the features of the running applications. If the traffic varies and requires connections to be changed  faster  than  the  existing  connections  can  be  rearranged,  the  management  overhead  will increase.  Examples  of  management  functions  include  setting  up  the  connections,  monitoring  and keeping track of the existing connections, and tearing them down when they are not needed.\n\nImplementing configuration changes in OCS can be performed using the following models:\n\n- All-stop model: In the all- stop model, each time a configuration needs to be made, the ongoing traffic stops.\n- Not-all-stop model: In the not-all-stop model, the change in configuration can be performed while other servers continue to send traffic without disruption.\n\nRelative  to  the  previously  proposed  software  defined  network  (SDN)  for  the  control  software implementation in Milestone 3 (Q2 2022) report, the same approach is considered for control and management of the OCSs. The control and management of the OCS can be performed in a centralized manner, where each backplane is connected to a centralized controller via a control link. Additionally, the management can be performed locally within each rack. This requires a direct control link between the backplane and the local control entity in that rack.",

Received components in the bill of materials include x86 servers, optical transceivers, optical and DAC cables and Xilinx smart NIC cards. The installed setup is highlighted in Fig. 13.\n\nCurrently, the team is progressing on setting up the six C-PON servers including Xilinx U25 NIC cards,  operating  systems,  bare-metal  hypervisor,  and  other  software  components  such  as  Vitis development platform, Xilinx Real-time library (XRT)..., etc. The hardware installation plan checklist has been reviewed and approved by the project manager and health and safety officer. The estimated deadline of the testbed readiness is by mid of Oct 2022.\n\nAdditionally, two Mellanox SN3700 trial switches were received and installed as shown in Fig. 14. These trial switches were loaned to Ultracell Network by Mellanox for an initial evaluation. Each switch is equipped with 32 ports of 200 Gb/s and offers 12.8 Tb/s bidirectional switching throughput between C-PON servers in the same rack. A Linux based networking operating system is installed on both switches to provide advanced switching capabilities such as network virtualization using VXLANs and IPv6 segment routing. It is worth mentioning that these switches support Layer-2 and Layer-3 networking functionalities.\n\nFigure 13: Installed rack servers of the C-PON testbed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 14: Installed rack servers and trial switch of the C-PON testbed\n\n<!-- image -->",

Meetings  were  held  on  12/08/2022  and 16/09/2022. It was agreed to model the spine and leaf data centre (done), the C-PON cell (done) and gather statistical information about the virtual reality or augmented reality (VR/AR) applications. The models were developed using linear programming and various simulation programs such as GNS3.\n\nIn  the  models  we  considered  the  ratio  of  the  requirements  of  VR/AR  applications  to  other applications in the edge. We also compared the cases of hosting VR/AR applications in C-PON and in BT's initial design in terms of:\n\n- The energy consumption.\n- The average delay.\n- The end-to-end delay.\n\nThe results were obtained for 100 users with two allocation schemes and two objectives after refinements and modifications according to feedback.\n\nAs  future  steps,  we  will  study  M/M/C  queues  modelling  for  the  switches  as  switches  have multiple queues per port (a queue per output port). This can reduce the MILP-based queuing delay that is based on M/M/1 to obtain more realistic lower values that can fit into the 150 ms end-to-end delay budget provided by BT.

    "text": "In the last decade, the exponential growth in the development of the modern digital technologies and the wide adoptions of such technologies across various industries have led to many disruptions globally. Evidence of such disruption is visible in sport stadiums and events arenas. The popularity of live sports and entertainment events are pushing for the creation of more engaging experience for instadium fans. Therefore, stadium owners are seeking ways to provide captivating services for fans that can compete with the over-the-top media streaming services. The smart stadium paradigm leverages high performance digital infrastructure along with IoT sensors and smart end-devices to deliver the desired improved experience in stadiums as well as to improve operational efficiency.\n\nSmart stadiums are established to enable demand-driven innovations that extend, build on top or leverage the existing stadium infrastructure. The term smart comes from the ability to collect data in real-time  and  apply  actions  with  little  or  no  human  intervention.  Through  introducing  a  range  of services  and  applications,  stadiums  are  set  up  to  provide  more  personalized,  convenient,  and  safe experiences  for  fans.  Smart  stadiums  can  improve  the  fans  experience  by  creating  a  personalized services for fans and thus increasing the revenue per customer, while reducing the operating costs for stadium owners. New tools such as Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) also provide new ways of experiencing live sports events.\n\nThe implementation of certain features in smart stadium requires edge computation particularly in  instances  where  the  feasibility  or  optimal  performance  of  such  features  is  dependent  on  in-situ computation. For example, the adoption of AR and VR technologies in stadium to provide enhanceduser-experienced would benefit immensely when edge computing capacity is near the smart stadium. In  a  stadium  with  up  to  100,000  attendees,  the  power  consumed  by  implementing  such  edge computing capability with a conventional setup is expected to approach 3.75 MW. In contrast, when networking accounts for 20% of IT power consumption, an edge computing setup that deploys C-PON technology in a stadium with similar capacity will reduce power consumption to 3.15 MW. On the other hand, when networking accounts for 80% of IT power consumption in the edge computing location, power consumption of edge computing setup that deploys C-PON technology will reduce to 1.35 MW.",

    "text": "AR/VR-assisted  event  viewing  adopts  extended  reality  (XR)  technology  to  process  captured contents (video and data streams) from live events. These processed contents are subsequently sent back to fans at the location of the event to deliver memorable immersive experiences that motivate fans to return for similar experiences. This is because of the personalized, convenient, and engaging experience delivered to fans (users) which enables the fans to select their preferred view and to select how the preferred view is experienced. Consequently, the AR/VR-assisted event viewing use case in smart  stadiums  helps  to  increase  revenue.  This  increase  in  revenue  complements  cost  reductions achieved  when  other  applications  and  services  of  the  smart  stadium,  which  enable  improved operational efficiency, are implemented.\n\nThere are two parts to the AR/VR-assisted event viewing in smart stadiums i.e., AR-assisted event viewing and VR-assisted event viewing. A high-level description of both AR-assisted and VR-assisted event viewing is given as follows:\n\n- AR-Assisted Event Viewing : AR technology is used to embed data streams obtained from events or from other sources into the video stream of the event. The modified stream is subsequently transmitted back to smart end-devices. Using such a technology, facts (such as real-time and non-real time stats) about players, teams and the game can be overlaid on the video stream that  is  sent  to  smart  end-devices.  AR-assisted  event  viewing  involves  the  insertion  of information in real-time into the video source. Thereafter, the modified video stream is sent to the audiences/users.\n- VR-Assisted  Event  Viewing :  VR-assisted  event  viewing  provides  an  immersive  viewing experience for fans with suitable smart end-devices e.g., a VR handset. In the context of smart stadium,  VR-assisted  viewing  technology  provides  both  fans  and  game  officials  with  the opportunity  to  experience  key  moments  of  the  event  again  in  an  immersive  manner. Furthermore, the experience provided by VR-assisted event viewing can be further improved when used in conjunction with omnidirectional (or 360-degree) cameras, which capture 360degree videos.\n\nThe AR/VR-assisted event viewing use case is easily complemented by other features of the smart stadium to deliver a memorable user-centric immersive experience of events held at the stadium. Such features  include  but  are  not  limited  to  enhanced  audio,  360-degree  event  viewing  and  in-stadium navigation. Furthermore, it is important to note that a smart stadium can be adapted for other events such as musical concerts and other sporting events. Consequently, AR/VR-assisted event viewing setup can also be adapted to function optimally when the smart stadium is being used to host unconventional\n\nevents. For example, a smart stadium with a functional AR/VR-assisted viewing infrastructure can be used to host a musical concert.",

For  example,  consider  an adventure park or safari where the AR/VR-assisted viewing helps to provide memorable personalized and enhanced experiences for visitors. In such deployments, C-PON-based edge computing platform can provide the required high performance while offering reduced cost and power consumption.",

    "text": "The  end-to-end  content  flow  described  earlier  helps  to  create  a  high-level  overview  of  the architectural set up required for AR/VR-assisted event viewing. At a high-level, enabling AR/VR-assisted event viewing in smart stadiums and in other use places requires some components as illustrated in Figure 2. These components include distributed cameras, network infrastructure, edge computing pod, smart end-devices, and IoT sensors. Each component is described as follows:\n\n- i. Distributed  Cameras :  Distributed  cameras  at  the  event  arena  capture  and  encode  video streams in the smart stadium. Subsequently, the captured data is sent to the edge computing pod for storage, processing, and analytics. The range of cameras deployed for sporting events in  smart  stadiums  can  also  include  360-degree  cameras  which  can  captures  video  in  all directions.\n- ii. Network Infrastructure : Network infrastructure provides connectivity from smart end-devices and sensors to the edge computing platform and from cameras to the edge computing platform. The interactive nature of AR/VR-assisted event viewing use case in smart stadium implies that a  low  latency  and  high  data  rate  network  infrastructure  is  required  to  deliver  an  optimal immersive experience.  This is because a network infrastructure with low latency and high data rate can enable the delivery of high-quality video streams to users (fans). The desired network infrastructure can be implemented using wired networking technologies, wireless networking technologies, or a combination of both. Wireless network infrastructure can be implemented\n\nusing Wi-Fi or radio access technologies such as 4G or 5G mobile networks. A high-performance wireless network can ensure that smart end-devices and IoT sensors enjoy adequate wireless coverage across the smart stadium. Consequently, 5G mobile network is a leading technology for establishing connectivity to distributed cameras, sensors, and smart end-devices because it offers  low  latency and high data rate which helps to deliver effective interactive immersive experience.  For  optimal  performance,  private  5G  cellular  network  can  be  established  and dedicated to a smart stadium. Additionally, next generation mobile network such as 6G can enable even better performance for AR/VR-assisted event viewing in smart stadiums since such technological  advancement  is  expected  to  deliver  higher  capacity  and  lower  latency.  Local consumption of high-quality content by users (fans) is important for maintaining favourable user perception of the AR/VR-assisted event viewing in smart stadiums. Network infrastructure can provide network capacity to support the AR/VR-assisted event viewing as well as support the other critical applications needed to operate and manage the smart stadium optimally. On the  one  hand,  a  single  flexible  network  infrastructure  with  integrated  intelligence  can  be deployed  in  such  a  scenario.  Alternatively,  dedicated,  and  independent  networks  can  be designed for critical services/applications and user-centric applications such as AR/VR-assisted event viewing.\n\n- iii.",

Edge Computing Pod : The edge computing infrastructure is of crucial importance for AR/VRassisted event viewing and in the wider smart stadium ecosystem. This is because applications like AR/VR-assisted event viewing are latency sensitive and will therefore benefit significantly when processing and analytics are performed at the edge of the network. The edge computing pod is responsible for decoding the captured content (video and data), storage of the decoded content  and  for  the  subsequent  processing  and  reformatting  of  the  decoded  content.  The transformation of collected data stream into insights and statistics that can be added to AR/VRassisted event viewing workflow is also performed at the edge computing pod. The outlined functions of the edge computing pod can be performed by a one or more applications that run at the edge computing pod. Such applications include processing intensive applications, which can perform the task of rendering of the graphics based on the view requested by each user (fan), as well as analytics applications which transform captured data stream into insights. Other applications  in  the  edge  computing  pod  may  also  be  responsible  for  embedding  generated insights into the video stream that is sent to fans. On the one hand, the edge computing pod can be owned and operated by the stadium owner/operator. Alternatively, the edge computing pod can be provided by a mobile network operator as a mobile edge computing infrastructure located in proximity to the event arena or stadium.\n- iv. Users (Smart End-devices and Applications) : Smart end-devices and the applications running on them deliver enhanced experience to users (fans) by receiving and decoding the processed content  sent  from  the  edge  computing  pod.  Subsequently,  smart  end-devices  and  the applications running on them also aid the high-quality presentation of the decoded content. Smart end-devices are simple devices such as simple AR/VR glasses, AR/VR lenses, smart TVs, mobile phones, and tablets that provide immersive experience. In a different context, smart end-devices can also be the source of (content) data that is integrated into the production\n\nworkflow. For example, consider a situation where smart end-devices collect and transmit data of a user's active view to the edge computing pod to ensure that the view sent to each user delivers  optimal  experience.  Alternatively,  smart  end-devices  can  also send  users'  location information to facilitate the generation of the right scene and accompanying audio stream.",

IoT Sensors : IoT sensors are very important in smart stadiums. Sensors collect data which can aid  the  generation of  augmented statistics  and  illustration.  Such  generated  graphics  can  be overlaid  on  (or  embedded  into) processed  video feed.  Sensors  can  be  integrated  into balls, clothing, and other smart wearables which are used to collect useful data that can aid AR/VRassisted event viewing.\n\nAlthough the functions of each component in the enabling ecosystem for AR/VR-assisted event viewing  is  essential,  subsequent  sections  of  this  report  focus  strictly  on  the  edge  computing  pod component of the ecosystem.

The  edge computing testbed consists of three important components as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n- i. Model Server : The model server is dedicated to pre-processing of received video contents. The model server is a content server which decodes, and stores captured video content.\n\n- ii. Normal Host Servers : These servers host virtual machines (VMs) or containers. Each VM or container  hosts  a  XR  application  which  retrieves  stored  video  content  from  the  model servers and processes the video contents to generate the corresponding view and format requested by a corresponding user. In the testbed developed for 5G Edge-XR project, a user requires a dedicated VM or container to render a desired view. The testbed comprises of 4 normal servers as illustrated in Figure 3. Each normal server can support up to 25 VMs (i.e., 25 users).\n- iii. Data Centre Network : A data centre network (DCN) interconnects all servers in the edge computing pod. The DCN adopted in the 5G Edge-XR project includes an edge gateway switch and links that interconnect servers in the edge computing pod. The edge gateway switch receives content (video and data) from the event arena and forwards it to the model server. The edge gateway switch also receives processed content from normal host servers and forwards such content to user smart end-devices.\n\nFigure 3: 5G Edge XR Project Edge Computing Testbed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe communication flow in edge computing pod of the 5G Edge-XR project is summarized in the illustration in Figure 4.

    "text": "In a simplistic research scenario as described earlier, the applications that enable AR/VR-assisted event viewing can run in a dedicated edge computing testbed. However, this is not expected in an ideal production  style  environment.  A  production  edge  computing  environment  will  support  other applications concurrently with the applications that enable AR/VR-assisted event viewing. In contrast with the simplistic edge computing infrastructure illustrated in Figure 3 and Figure 4, which is designed to support up to 100 users, a production style edge computing platform is expected to support more (up  to  130,000)  users/fans.  Consequently,  more  servers  are  expected  in  an  ideal  production environment to support a wide range of applications and a larger number of users. Furthermore, the simplistic DCN illustrated in Figure 3 is also replaced with a spine-and-leaf-based data centre network in the production environment as show in Figure 5.\n\nThe illustration of a production style edge computing platform in  Figure 5 comprises two pods, where each pod consists of six racks. Each rack contains six servers that can be for compute or storage. Each  server  has  network  interface  cards  with  which  it  connects  to  the  spine  and  leaf  datacentre\n\nnetwork. The production environment also contains dedicated hardware for the network management as illustrated in Figure 5. In each pod, this hardware is composed of a switch per rack. Each switch is connected  to  two  management  switches.  For  resilience,  each  pod  defines  three  availability  zones where each has two racks as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nIn the production environment, multiple tenants can request different applications while sharing the physical hardware. A tenant of the production edge computing platform can require a container, a single  VM,  a  whole  server,  or  more  resources.  Furthermore,  frequent  inter-server  and  intra-sever interactions  between  the  applications  running  on  the  edge  computing  platform  is  expected  in  a production environment. The network deployed in such a production environment must be adaptable and flexible to setup, manage and enable all required connectivity in the edge computing platform at the expected performance levels.\n\nFigure 5: A Production Style Edge Computing Environment for Smart Stadiums with Spine and Leaf DCN.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Hence,  a  high-performance environment/setup is required to deliver the AR/VR-assisted events viewing in smart stadiums. High performance in more specific terms involves low latency and high data rate communication as well as high availability and resilience of network infrastructure, content storage, and processing infrastructure. Furthermore, the setup must be very flexible and scale effectively to support increased uptake  of  the  AR/VR-assisted  events  viewing  by  stadium  goers  (fans).  The  C-PON  low  power consumption is a key enabler for the scaling of the infrastructure and its economic operation.  The\n\nunderlying features and value proposition of C-PON make it a suitable technology to provide edge computing  infrastructure  to  support  AR/VR-assisted  event  viewing  in  smart  stadiums.  These  value propositions are also applicable for other features of smart stadiums that require (or would benefit from)  edge  computation.  Consequently,  the  spine-and-leaf-based  production  style  environment  in Figure 5 can be replaced with comparable C-PON-based production style environment in Figure 6.\n\n- Scalability : High scalability is required as smart stadiums evolve and grow with the addition of new  assets (cameras, sensors, capacity, technologies  and features etc.). The cellular architecture of C-PON platform would support proportional scaling of the platform to support the introduction of novel user smart end-devices, cameras, network capacity and features.\n- Power/Energy  Efficient  Computing :  The  adoption  of  the  C-PON  platform  in  place  of  a traditional  edge  computing  pod  can  enable  significant  (up  to  80%)  reduction  in  the  power consumed. The energy efficient computing capacity provided by a C-PON platform at the edge can also encourage hosting a wide range of smart stadium applications which include but is not limited to AR/VR events viewing. Furthermore, a C-PON-based edge computing pod can also support virtual network functions that are needed to set up public or private mobile networks which can enable wireless connectivity in smart stadiums.\n\nFigure 6: A Production Style Edge Computing Environment for Smart Stadiums with C-PON DCN.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Flexibility and Programmability : The C-PON platform provides a programmable network fabric for edge computing because it is SDN-enabled.

The high bandwidth of the C-PON platform can also minimise the queuing delay experienced while using smart stadium applications.\n- Reduced Latency : Relative to conventional DCNs, C-PON offers about 82% reduction in end-toend latency. Therefore, C-PON offers reduced total latency for video processing, computing and analytics applications that support smart stadium applications and features (including features such  as  AR/VR-assisted  event  viewing).  This  is  very  useful  for  applications  that  provide immersive user experience which have ultra-low latency performance requirements. Furthermore, the C-PON fabric can also be programmed to ensure that the latency required by such user-centric applications is satisfied. The same also applies for critical applications needed for optimal operation of smart stadiums.\n- Resilience and Reliability (High Availability): The network architecture of the C-PON platform, as illustrated in Figure 6, is designed as a highly resilient network that is capable of mitigating link  or  node  failure to  ensure minimal disruption to applications or services running on the platform.  This  is  because  the  C-PON  fabric  provides  multiple  paths  between  two  distinct servers/nodes in the C-PON platform. Therefore, enabling a reliable and resilient platform to support the AR/VR-assisted event viewing as well as other important features in smart stadiums that intend to leverage the computing capacity provided by the C-PON platform.\n- Low Cost : Relative to conventional DCNs, C-PON enables up to 43% reduction in CAPEX and 27% reduction in OPEX. Therefore, C-PON offers a cost-effective platform to support smart stadium applications at the network edge.\n\nThe performance of C-PON relative to a conventional DCN can be measured by designing metrics to estimate the impact of the outlined value proposition of C-PON.",

    "text": "Power consumption saving as a result of using C-PON in a smart stadium with AR/VR.\n\n- In this estimation, a large stadium that accommodates 100,000 fans is considered.\n- Based on BT's deployment setup, each server can host 25 virtual machines (VMs). Each VM is dedicated to one user, providing multiple views from cameras, augmented reality, and virtual reality.\n- Thus, 4000 servers are required for a large stadium that accommodates 100,000 fans. However, the  number  of  servers  needed  is  typically  higher  to  allow  for  server  failures  and  provide redundancy. Thus, 5000 servers are considered in this use case.\n- A typical server and associated networking power consumption is 500W. The typical power usage  effectiveness  (PUE)  in  an  installation  of  this  size  is  1.5  (i.e.,  the  facility  uses  air\n\nconditioning, has AC-DC-AC power conversion losses, and uses lighting etc.). Thus, for each watt of IT, a total of 1.5W is consumed.\n\n- The 5000 servers and their networking (500W each) thus result in an IT power consumption of 2.5 MW. Taking the PUE of 1.5 into account, the power consumption is 3.75 MW.\n- Networking is currently 20% of the total IT power consumption in a data centre installation and is expected to grow to 80% of the data centre IT power consumption. This growth is because clock speeds in processors have been growing very slowly (from 1.5 GHz to 3.5 GHz) over the past decade and the number of cores per processor has also grown very slowly. In contrast, over the last 15 years or so, the communication data rate per server has grown from 1Gb/s to 100Gb/s with roadmaps to 1Tb/s per server over the next decade.\n- Taking a conservative estimate where networking represents 20% of the IT power consumption, then networking represents a power consumption of 0.5 MW. C-PON saves 80% of this, which is a saving of 0.4 MW. Taking the PUE into account the 0.4 MW becomes 0.6 MW.\n- A typical home in the UK consumes 9000 kWh per year. Assuming the smart stadium processing cell is used for the stadium when the stadium is operational and for the city during other times, the 0.6 MW power saving as a result of C-PON is equivalent to eliminating the power demands of (600 kW x 24 x 365 / 9000) 584 homes.\n- At  the  other  end  when  networking  accounts  for  80%  of  the  IT  power  consumption,  then networking is 2 MW in this facility. C-PON saves 80% of this, which is 1.6 MW power saving. Taking the PUE of 1.5 into account, the saving is 2.4 MW. This is equivalent to saving the energy needed by 2336 UK homes.\n\nThese power savings are due to a single deployment in one stadium. The savings scale as more facilities such as shopping centers, museums, schools, enterprises etc. are considered and are equipped with AR / VR capabilities.\n\nCarbon emission saving as a result of using C-PON in a smart stadium with AR/VR.\n\n- Carbon emissions are 0.193 kg of CO2e per kWh in the U.K.",

    "text": "The testbed of the second use case (AR/VR applications) will be deployed in BT Labs at Adastral Park. The team has been having monthly meetings with Louise Krug (Head of Sustainability Research at BT) since the start of the project to discuss the development of the second use case and interfacing with existing research systems at BT labs. To validate C-PON core value propositions, Louise suggested that we can select a use case that best demonstrates the core value propositions of C-PON. Louise has also suggested a particular focus on the energy efficiency value proposition of C-PON by demonstrating that C-PON can lead to power consumption saving in BT networks and data centres, since reducing energy consumption is a very high priority within BT networks and data centres.\n\nPrior to C-PON testbed arriving at BT labs for planned showcase, the team is working closely with Louise to have a published Ultracell Networks -BT White Paper and a Journal Paper. These papers are expected to provide further justification and motivation for the show case at BT labs. The papers will include a model that compares the performance of C-PON data centre network to a state-of-the-art data centre network (i.e., Spine and Leaf). They analysis uses gathered statistical information about the virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) applications. The model is being developed using mixed integer  linear  programming  (MILP)  optimisation.  Additionally,  the  use  case  setup  is  also  being simulated using a network simulation programme i.e., GNS3. The model has a number of constraints that must be satisfied. For example, some constraints help to ensure that certain quality of service (QoS)  thresholds  (e.g.,  delay)  are  not  exceeded  while  other  constraints  ensure  that  the systems' capacities, such as the links speed, the nodes processing and memory capacity, are not exceeded. The model  evaluation  scenario  considered  the  co-existence  of  other  applications  alongside  VR/AR applications in the edge computing platform. The model provides a theoretical basis for understanding the expected results from the developed testbed and provides benchmark numbers for comparison in terms of:\n\n- The energy consumption.\n- The average delay.\n- The end-to-end delay.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the model will demonstrate the value proposition of C-PON and its ability to satisfy demands, with lower power consumption and lower delay. The model will also show how C-PON operates under various system conditions in terms of utilisation and demand.\n\nAnother outcome of the frequent discussions and interactions with Louise is the outlined roadmap for the expected showcase of C-PON testbed at BT labs as shown in Figure 7.",

The steps of this showcase\n\nplan, which closely align with the timeline (and some deliverables) of the ECOICE project, as discussed and agreed with Louise are as follows:\n\n- Step  1: Design  simple  functional  testbeds  (i.e.,  C-PON  and  state-of-art  DCN)  for  a  direct comparison (DT12) -the team will work on preparing the implementation of the different parts of the C-PON cell and spine-and-leaf-based edge computing platform  to setup two functional testbeds (spine-and-leaf is the state of the art platform to be compared to C-PON).\n- Step 2: Select a use case to validate C-PON performance. (DFT2) -the team will discuss and decide on the scenarios that will be implemented in the chosen use case.\n- Step 3: Demonstrate (showcase) value of C-PON relative to another DCN at BT labs -deploying designed and implemented C-PON cell and the Spine-and-Leaf architecture to demonstrate the chosen  use  case  under  different  scenarios  i.e.,  traffic  and  demands  patterns.  This  will demonstrate  the  key  benefits  of  C-PON  relative  to  spine-and-leaf  in  terms  of  power consumption and latency.\n- Step 4: Get buy-in of engineers at BT lab and business units in BT -publishing joint BT-UCN White Paper and Journal paper with modelling and simulation results alongside the deployment of  functional  C-PON  cell  that  demonstrates  the  value  of  C-PON  will  help  get  the  buy-in, involvement and approval of BT engineers for the C-PON technology.\n- Step 5: BT engineers/departments can suggest application or traffic to be considered for further evaluation -After  the  buy-in  of  BT  engineers  is  gained,  engineers  can  suggest  preferred applications and traffic patterns for conducting further evaluations in the deployed testbeds.\n- Step 6: Run suggested traffic/application on C-PON for performance validation (delay and jitter) (DT13, DT14, DT15, DFT3) -Suggested  application  (or  traffic  patterns)  are  deployed  on  the testbed (or sent through) the testbeds to further validate the performance of the C-PON cell using metrics such as delay and jitter.\n\nFigure 7: Plans for showcase at BT Labs\n\n<!-- image -->",

    "text": "Ultracell  Networks  Ltd  has  prepared  this  document  for  BEIS  as  evidentiary  information  of achievement of key milestones and objectives relating to the deliverables of milestone six (MS6) the first quarter of 2023 for the Cellular Passive Optical Networks (C-PON) platform of the Energy-efficient Cellular Optical Interconnects for Clouds and Edge-processing (ECOICE) project.\n\nWe are confident that we have understood and met the objectives and are providing a high quality, value-based report that meets the requirements as defined in the project. In summary:\n\n- We achieved the technical deliverable DT12 within WP4 which is the first implementation of C-PON control software. We started with an overview of C-PON control software as well as a description of the control software implementation requirements and components. Furthermore, we outline the C-PON control software implementation plan. Finally, we state the milestones achieved within the outlined implementation plan as a result of the C-PON testbed practical implementation in Ultracell Network's laboratory within Q1 2023.\n- We achieved a deliverable, DFT2, of the C-PON field trial work package i.e., WP7 which discusses CPON field trial scenario and uses-cases selection. We started by reviewing augmented reality (AR) and  virtual  reality  (VR)  applications  before  outlining  the  deployment  architecture  and  the requirements  of  such  applications.  Thereafter,  the  C-PON  value  propositions  and  how  they  are applicable to AR/VR applications are discussed. We also give a summary of the use case of AR/VR application that has been selected for the C-PON field trial. Finally, we stated the desired outcomes of the C-PON field trial before outlining important next steps and timelines for the ECOICE project.\n\nThis  document forms a detailed report on the work undertaken on the C-PON platform of the ECOICE project from 2 nd   January 2023 to  31 th   March  2022, focused on the two deliverables in the ECOICE project. The organisation of this report is as follows:\n\n- Section 1 is an introduction.\n- Section 2 discusses  the technical  deliverable on the first implementation of the C-PON control software.\n- Section 3 details a deliverable on C-PON field trial scenario and use cases selection.",

    "text": "Cellular Passive Optical Network (C-PON) is a platform that provides cloud or edge Data Centres (DCs)  with  effective,  resilient  and  energy  efficient  computing  for  various  applications.  The  C-PON technology organises the servers of this computing platform into C-PON cells. Each cell contains several racks and a data centre network fabric that enables connectivity between and within the racks.\n\nThe ECOICE project aims to transform the C-PON technology from Technology Readiness Level (TRL)  3  to  TRL6  where  a  C-PON  demonstration  prototype  will  be  fitted  with  monitoring  and measurement systems to verify its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) including:\n\n- Reduced power consumption.\n- Reduced latency.\n- Increased resilience.\n\nThe  engineers  in  Ultracell  Networks  Ltd  are  involved  in  the  development  of  the  key  C-PON components which include:\n\n- C-PON NIC card: The C-PON card is a programmable network interface card (NIC) that is attached to the servers to perform networking functions. The C-PON card currently under development can have one or two ports with speeds of 100 Gbps, 50 Gbps, 25 Gbps, or 10 Gbps. One form of C-PON cards adopted in this project is an FPGA-based programmable NIC, where different functionalities can be implemented through high level languages (e.g., C++, Python, P4) or hardware description languages (e.g., Verilog and, VHDL).\n- Optical Line Manager (OLM): the manager in C-PON that controls the networking in the C-PON platform.\n- Optical back plane: Is the network connecting the servers within a rack. Typically, each rack has the same structure for the intra-rack network. There are two options in C-PON which are 1) A network of fibre cables and passive devices connecting transceivers and ports of the C-PON cards of the servers within the same rack. 2) An active programmable optical switch connecting the servers within the rack through fibre cables.\n- Control  software:  The  algorithms  loaded  to  C-PON  cards  and  the  OLM  that  dynamically  assign bandwidth and govern the communication.\n- C-PON  cell  development:  A  collection  of  racks  connected  through  a  C-PON  fabric.  These  racks contain the computing units containing CPU, memory, and hard disk resources in addition to an operating system. In this project, we use rack-mounted servers. The servers in C-PON should have PCI express slots to host one or more C-PON cards. The operating system should support the drivers required by the developed C-PON card/cards.\n\nSeveral industrial collaborators are involved with the use-case development and validation of components, systems, and subsystems of the C-PON platform, including:\n\n- Vodafone (wireless networks, IoT, and cloud and fog DCs) collaborating with Ultracell Networks on the first use case, Factory of the Future: This use case focuses on the automation of services with the manufacturing sector.\n- BT (wired network, cloud DCs and fog computing) collaborating with Ultracell Networks on the second use case, Stadium of the Future: This use case focuses on the AR/VR enabled services within smart buildings such as stadiums.\n\nThis ECOICE project report focuses on the deliverables of",

    "text": "The control software plays a central role in the C-PON platform, acting as the key enabler for communication between different entities. It consists of algorithms, protocols, and applications that dynamically assign and manage network resources. The control software can be implemented as a single central unit. In such case, the optical line manager (OLM) accommodates the control software to act as a centralised controller. The main advantage of this model is the ability to have a central view of the network which helps to collect information and utilise the network resources. However, one drawback faced by this model is that the centralised controller can be considered as a single point of failure. An alternative approach for the implementation of the control software involves distributed instances of the control software running within the C-PON cell which act collectively as a single logical unit. The presence of multiple control entities in the distributed control architecture helps to overcome the single point of failure issue associated with the central controller. However, sharing the updates between the instances in a distributed control architecture can introduce additional overheads.\n\nIn this stage of the ECOICE project, the implementation of a central controller is being considered. However, multiple instances of the control software run concurrently in the OLM to ensure resiliency and reliability of the control architecture of the C-PON platform. The C-PON control software leverages the  software  defined  network  paradigm  (SDN)  where  the  control  plane  and  management  plane functionalities are decoupled from the data plane functionalities. Such paradigm offers high flexibility to effectively manage the network resources within the C-PON platform. To enable the communication within the C-PON cell, the control software is mainly responsible for the following:\n\n- Perform the initial configuration of the C-PON cards within the C-PON cell.\n- Compute the end-to-end paths after applying predefined policies such as routing, load balancing and resilience polices.\n- Compute the forwarding tables and periodically updates the tables as required.\n- Distributes the forwarding tables to the corresponding C-PON cards and update the tables based on changes in the network.\n- Preserve  a  global  view  of  the  C-PON  platform  and  maintain  accurate  records  of  the  network devices and links.\n- Use  the  collected  statistics  to  monitor  the  operation  of  the  network,  and  to  optimise  the performance of the C-PON platform.",

    "text": "ONOS is an open-source network operating system used to create and deploy dynamic network services. ONOS is a SDN controller that offers both the control and management planes functionalities. Hence, ONOS performs the initial configurations, manages the network components to enable the communication,  and  monitors  the  overall  system.  ONOS  features  seamless  customisation  of  the routing, management, and monitoring services, and thus enables high scalability, high availability, and improves the overall performance of the network. Although ONOS can be implemented in a distributed manner where a cluster of identical instances can be installed in different network devices, it remains a  logical  centralised  entity.  This  is  mainly  to  sustain  the  simplicity  of  a  centralised  controller.  Each instance can take over workloads from other instances to apply policies, such as load balancing, in case of  failure  in  one  of  the  instances.  For  overall  visibility  and  management  ONOS  provides  a  simple graphical user interface (GUI) to maintain information of the network. ONOS has a defined architecture which comprises three tiers which abstract the operation of the devices and applications. The tiers are briefly explained as follows:\n\n- Tier 1: This tier is also identified as the southbound application protocol interface (API). This tier includes the modules and protocols that facilitates the communication with the network devices (i.e., data plane devices) in the system. ONOS relies on the southbound APIs to mediate between the distributed cores and the network devices. Such mediation involves sending instructions and receiving sensory data to and from the corresponding network component through the southbound APIs.\n- Tier  2: The  second  tier  comprises  of  the  distributed  cores  that  are  critical  components  of  a centralised logical controller. It allows the separation of the physical data and control functions. These cores are instrumental for managing the distributed instances of the control software. Each core  acts  as  an  individual  subsystem  that  could  independently  keep  track  of  network  state information. However, all cores preserve a similarly high-level design architecture, including two components: the manager component and the store component.\n- Tier 3: The third layer is also known as the Northbound API layer or the northbound APIs. This layer is attached to the application layer to convey network state information to the applications. This information includes abstractions to the network devices, the links, and the topology graph which are used by the applications to update and enforce the predefined policies.\n\nIn order to communicate with the data plane components (i.e., the C-PON cards), the P4runtime API is installed on both ONOS (i.e., P4runtime controller) and the managed devices in the data plane (i.e., P4runtime agent). ONOS uses the P4 runtime interface (i.e., southbound API) to interact with the\n\nC-PON cards in the platform. P4runtime controls the P4 defined data plane and serves as the interface between the applications and the managed devices.",

    "text": "Generally, a high-level architecture of the P4 pipeline contains three customisable engines (i.e., blocks), namely, the parser, the deparser, and the Match-Action engine. Each engine has a specific task that is discussed in detail below:\n\n- Parser engine: The parser is the first block that receives packets and decouples the headers form the payload. The parser includes three predefined states, namely start, accept, and reject; with the flexibility to define other states. The parser implements these states sequentially and it can set a default  state  to  be  executed.  After,  traversing  all  stages  of  the  parser  engine,  the  packets  are passed to the second engine for further processing.\n- Match-Action engine: The second block is responsible of modifying the headers and the control packets. The packets are received and processed in a first in first out (FIFO) order. The MatchAction  engine  applies  actions  on  the  headers  such  as  forwarding  to  a  specific  port,  dropping packets, or taking no action. Typically, the match-action engine takes the match field value, which include data such as the IP address or the MAC address, as input and performs an action based on the  match-action table. Additionally, a  default  action  can  be  specified to  any  value  that  is not included in the list of the Match-Action tables. The match-action engine can contain several matchaction  tables  which  is  adaptable  based  on  the  pipeline  design. The  three  match types  used  to compare the match field values with the values in the tables are:\n- o Exact Match: This type compares the exact match field value of the received packet to the available IP addresses in the match-action table. If the same IP address is encountered, the equivalent action will be performed on the packet.\n- o Longest Prefix Match (LPM): In this case, the match field value does not necessarily have be an exact match with the value in the match-action table. However, the longest prefix of the value is selected to match the value in the table. This is helpful in minimising the number of forwarding match-action entries.\n- o Ternary: This match type compares the input data with a wildcard mask in the match-action table. This is particularly useful when dealing with variable length fields.\n- Deparser engine: The final block of the pipeline combines the packet and the header back into the original  shape.  After  the  deparsing  process,  the  packets  are  left  with  one  of  three  main destinations: the packets can either be transmitted to the next ports, or directed to the controller, or they can be dropped.",

The selection of the best paths can follow various policies based on the network requirements. The main outcome of the algorithms is the forwarding tables which are pushed to the data plane devices to instruct the packet forwarding actions. In case of updates encountered in the network, the  devices  send  the  information  to  the  control  software  which  reflects  these  updates  in  the forwarding  tables.

In addition to considering the specification of C-PON components such as OLM, smart NIC cards and the backplane as detailed in the previous deliverables of the ECOICE project, the practical implementation of the C-PON cell has also considered the following additional factors:\n\n- The market availability of hardware as well as the compatibility of software.\n- The manufacturing limitations and supply chain issues.\n- The level of the programmability of the smart NIC cards and the backplane switches.\n- The interoperability with different TCP/IP stack's networking protocols i.e., MPLS, OSP F, etc.\n\nFigure 1: C-PON testbed implementation perspective overview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo determine the testbed components options and associate them with the C-PON specifications and requirements, we divided the development of C-PON testbed functional and engineering elements into three levels as shown in Figure 1. These levels helped us to define the selection criteria of the applicable testbed components within the project timeline and budget.\n\nThe C-PON testbed implementation fulfils four main functional requirements; these are listed and described as follows:\n\n- Intra-rack Communication: The communication between the servers in the same rack is preformed through the optical backplane switch in that rack. Using the connected C-PON card that is installed in each server, traffic between servers in the same rack is forwarded via the ports of the optical backplane switch in each rack. Intra-rack communication involves invoking the forwarding entries that are listed in the switch configuration memory to ensure that matched communication between servers is within the same rack. These entries can be match-based on MAC or IP addresses and are managed, and periodically configured by the control software.\n- Inter-Rack  Communication: The  communication  between  each  two  racks  in  the  C-PON  cell  is performed through two main intermediate elements i.e., the designated relay servers or the OLM. Both  elements  are  equipped  with  smart  NIC  cards  (C-PON  cards)  that  perform  the  routing  and forwarding between two servers in different racks. Additionally, the control software should be aware of the resources requested by the communicating server pairs as well as those requested by intermediate elements such as the OLM and the relay servers. The control software computes the best  path  and  provides  load-balancing  between  the  connected  entities  to  satisfy  the  QoS requirements and the predefined power consumption policies.\n- Traffic Processing: C-PON control software implementation is built to monitor, optimise, and adapt the  networking  services  by  analysing  the  traffic  patterns.  Control  software  can  perform  traffic prioritisation, measure, and analyse the resources utilisation of the connected servers in the C-PON cell. Typically, a software agent will be deployed in each server to monitor a set of resources such as CPU, memory, NIC queues, etc.",

For example, consider use cases of AR/VR application for smart manufacturing and smart stadiums where ultralow end-to-end latency is required. The use case processing functionality will allow the translation of each use case's processing requirements into specific configuration parameters of the control software  within  the  available  networking  capacities  and  the  computing  capabilities  of  the interconnected servers of the C-PON cell.",

The achievements and lessons learned can be summarised as follows:\n\n- All the three servers and the attached Xilinx SmartNIC were successfully initialised and configured.\n- The basic P4 pipelines are successfully deployed.\n- The physical connections between the three servers were initiated without major issues. A sample of the connectivity test between the two servers is shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: Sample of connectivity test between two servers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- ONOS SDN controller and the C-PON control software dependent libraries and drivers are installed and activated as shown in Figure 5. To support the compatibility of Xilinx P4runtime APIs and ONOS P4 runtime we successfully modified the in-band telemetries and server subsystems.\n\nFigure 5: ONOS control software enabled modules and drivers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The  C-PON  servers  testbed  resources  information  have  been  aggregated  and  exchanged successfully with the control software.

In addition, we have programmed  an  advanced  forwarding  algorithm  that  complies  with  the  C-PON  optimisation constraints and utilises the telemetries such as RTT, server statistics, etc. to periodically compute the optimal forwarding rules between the servers in the C-PON testbed.\n\nFigure 6: An agent pushes the server statistics to C-PON ONOS controller.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 7: A sample of received server statistics at the ONOS controller.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed C-PON control software implementation plan has been completed.",

As previously mentioned, AR/VR applications cover a wide range of use cases. In the recent years, the market has been rapidly growing as more industries and applications are making use of these AR/VR technologies. In general, the AR/VR market can be divided into the following categories:\n\n- AR Advertising : Focuses on mobile applications advertising that are mostly deployed within social media platforms.\n- AR Hardware : Focuses on the development of the peripheral hardware such as AR headsets and glasses.\n- AR  Software :  Can  be  divided  based  on  the  applications  such  as  social  media,  gaming,  and eCommerce applications.\n- VR Advertising : Focuses on advertisements shown in gaming platforms and VR videos.\n- VR Hardware :  refers  to  the  visual  and  audio  devices  such  as  tethered  head-mounted  displays (HMDs) and stand-alone HMD headsets.\n- VR Software : Refer to VR games, VR videos or any application that requires and uses VR peripherals i.e., VR headsets, sensors, etc.\n\nFurthermore, these categorise feed into the market's revenue and penetration rates. The main source of revenue is from in-app purchases of application and games, in-app advertisements, AR/VR software and hardware purchases. The AR/VR market are driven by:\n\n- Increasing technical capability meets increasing number of viable use cases:\n- o Increasing graphical realism\n- o Increasing remote streaming capability\n- o Step changes in processing power, streaming capability, graphical interfaces\n- o Technology is becoming 'mature'\n- Increasing commercial pressures to:\n- o Increase productivity (virtual prototyping, meetings)\n- o Eliminate travel costs (VR)\n- o Improve worker safety (AR onsite, VR training)\n- o Lower carbon footprint (travel)\n- o Reduce worker errors (training)\n- o Protect worker health (training/operations for hazardous environments)\n\nThese drives for change require more powerful edge processing for 'local' applications, drive for low latency 5G connectivity and resurgence of 'On Prem' servers to tackle the challenges arising of the current constraints on bandwidth and latency.\n\nMoreover, in recent technical reports there has been constant references to the ability of VR and AR to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of different applications. This is mainly due to reduced travel requirements for certain activities such as remote training.

    "text": "The  architectural  setup  for  each  use  case  of  AR/VR  applications  can  be  as  simple  as  a  single standalone end-user device (i.e., HMD) that performs all the functions required to support a functional use case of the AR/VR application. In such architectural setup, the standalone end device is embedded with all  components i.e., input, processing, and output components, required in an AR/VR system. However, the functional and non-functional requirements of many known, emerging, and future AR/VR applications  are  not  easily  satisfied  by  this  simplistic  architectural  setup.  This  is  because  AR/VR applications  require  seamless  access  to  sufficient  computing  capacity  while  ensuring  optimal  user experience. For many AR/VR applications, the end-user devices are strictly unable to provide sufficient computing  capacity  to  support  the  computationally  intensive  processing  demands  that  must  be performed. Thus, prompting the emergence of other deployment architecture (architectural setup) for AR/VR applications. Such deployment architectures offload some or all processing capability from enduser devices.\n\nIn addition to the input, processing, and output components of simplistic standalone end-user deployment  architecture  for  AR/VR  applications,  offloading  (in-whole  or  in-part)  of  processing capabilities  from  end-user  devices  introduces  networks  as  an  essential  component  of  AR/VR application  deployment.  Hence,  networks  provide  an  infrastructure  that  can  support  the  seamless deployment of AR/VR applications. On one hand, the introduction of networks into the architectural setup for AR/VR applications can be as simple as the use of wired links to connect the end-user devices to a local workstation. On the other hand, the introduction of networks can be as complex as the use of wireless (i.e., 3G, 4G, 5G and Wi-Fi) network or the public internet as a medium to connect end-user devices to remote servers at the edge or in the cloud. Wireless networks are somewhat preferred because they enable seamless mobility for the users of an AR/VR application.\n\nGenerally, the architectural setups deployed for AR/VR application is defined by the location of the core processing functions enabling that application. Examples of such core processing functions include multimedia composition and video graphics rendering. Using this principle, coarse and fine classification  approaches  for  AR/VR  application deployment  architectures  exists.  Both  classification approaches are briefly  reviewed  below. The  illustration  in  Figure  8  also  gives  an  overview  of  both classification approaches.\n\nFigure 8: Classification of AR/VR Application Deployment Architectures\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consequently, remote rendering architecture has the capability of supporting certain use cases of AR/VR applications that are infeasible when a client-side rendering architecture is adopted.",

    "text": "Fine classification: A fine classification of AR/VR application deployment architectures provides an alternative  to  the  coarse  classification  approach  discussed  earlier.  A  fine  classification  approach categorises the deployment architecture of AR/VR applications as localised, cloud-based, edge-based or hybrid deployment architectures. These deployment architectures are reviewed as follows:\n\n- Localised: Two variants  of  the  localised  architecture  are  possible;  one  variant  of  the  localised architecture  places  AR/VR  functions  in  local  servers  while  the  other  variant  implements  a standalone system where an AR/VR display device performs all processing function as well as the function of displaying processed  contents. On  one  hand,  the  first variant requires the\n\nestablishment of network connectivity between the local servers and the display devices of endusers  which  can  lead  to  increased  delay.  On  the  other  hand,  the  second  variant  is  ideal  for application with ultra-low latency requirement. However, it is required that a standalone AR/VR end-user device must have sufficient processing capability as well as battery capacity to support computationally intensive AR processing functions and to support the presentation of processed content to the end-user. These requirements are not easily jointly satisfied on consumer devices .\n\n- Cloud-based: This  architecture  implements  cloud  offloading;  hence,  the  servers  that  perform computationally intensive AR/VR core functions, are placed in the cloud. Display devices are thin clients which receive processed content from cloud-based AR servers over the public internet. This architecture is largely suitable for applications/use cases that are highly tolerant to latency since users are susceptible to increased latency under cloud-based architecture.\n- Edge-based: This architecture implements edge offloading; hence, the display devices remain thin clients which receive processed content from the edge-based server. In contrast with the cloudbased architecture, the servers, which perform computationally intensive AR/VR functions, are placed  closer  to  the  display  client  at  the  edge  of  the  network.  Consequently,  the  architecture reduces the latency; hence, making it suitable for AV/VR application use cases with (ultra-)low latency requirements and other latency-critical applications.\n- Hybrid: This  architecture  offers  both  cloud  offloading  and  edge  offloading  options  for  AR/VR applications. Hence, it provides support for diverse use cases of AR/VR applications with diverging latency  requirements  concurrently  by  enabling  selection  of  a  suitable  location  for  processing functions  based  on  each  use  case.",

Generally, the choice of the architectural setup deployed for a specific AR/VR application under a selected use case  largely  depends  on  the  computation/processing,  latency  and  bandwidth  required  under  that scenario.

    "text": "The  requirements  of  AR/VR  applications  vary  with  the  use  case  being  considered.  These requirements of an AR/VR application dictate the deployment architecture that can be adopted for the application.  The  primary  requirements  of  traditional  AR/VR  application  are  ideally  focused  on processing and presentation. However, adoptions of certain deployment architectures (i.e., architectures  that  offload  processing)  for  an  AR/VR  application  brings  communication  network requirements into focus as well.\n\nIn the context of the ECOICE project, requirements focused on the presentation performed by end-user  device  is  out  of  scope.  In  contrast,  processing  and  communication  network  focused\n\nrequirements associated with AR/VR applications fall within the scope of the ECOICE project. However, given that the core technological proposition of the ECOICE project (i.e., C-PON architecture) aims to interconnect  processing  servers  using  a  novel  network  architecture,  the  discussions  of  AR/VR application  requirements  are  directed  towards  communication  networks  requirement  as  against processing requirements. Generally, the processing and network requirements of AR/VR applications under different use cases include delay, capacity, availability, scalability, sustainability, and adaptability as  illustrated  in  Figure  9.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  satisfaction  of  these  requirements  could contribute  to  metrics  that  are  evaluated  to  determine  compliance  with  predefined  service-level agreements (SLAs) for AR/VR application deployments under different use cases.\n\nFigure 9: Requirements of AR/VR applications under different use cases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Delay: Delay is an important requirement for all use cases of AR/VR applications. The delay metric determines  the  feasibility  of  each  use  case  of  an  AR/VR  application  as  well  as  the  quality  of experience of end-users. An explicit estimation of end-to-end delay sums up transmission delays, propagation delay, processing delay and queuing delay experienced across processing and network infrastructures.  Based  the  properties  of  the  AR/VR  application  under  consideration  and  the corresponding use case of that application being considered, end-to-end delay requirement of an AR/VR application  could  be  moderate  (non-critical),  low,  or  extreme  (i.e.,  ultra-low  latency  or critical). For instance, ultra-low latency is a characteristic feature of AR-assisted surgery (an AR/VR application use case) where high delay is life-threatening. Although, the selection of a deployment architecture for specific use case of AR/VR application can have significant impact on the delay experienced  by  users, evaluating the individual contribution  of  computing  and  network components to end-to-end delay is also important for optimisation purposes.\n- Capacity: The capacity requirement of AR/VR applications is focused on having enough computing and  network  resources  to  deliver  the  expected  performance.",

Compute  capacity  for  an  AR/VR\n\napplication  covers  both  processing  and  storage  capacity  since  the  computing  infrastructure deployed  for  an  AR/VR  application  usually  requires  (in-situ)  content/data  storage  to  enable optimal performance. Furthermore, AR/VR applications are generally known to be computationally intensive application. On the other hand, the network capacity requirement i.e., bandwidth/data rate of an AR/VR application deployment can be low, moderate, and extreme (high)  depending  on  the  properties  of  the  AR/VR  application  under  consideration  and  the corresponding use case of the application that is being considered.\n\n- Availability: The availability requirement of AR/VR application is focused on ensuring that endusers can access the system deployed to support the AR/VR application irrespective of its location i.e.,  end-users  should  receive  response  to  their  specific  service  request.  Given  that  AR/VR applications are user-facing, this requirement is of vital importance. This is because the availability of AR/VR application may be directly linked to performance and financial viability of the application since availability contributes to user perception and experience of the service being offered under each use case of an AR/VR application. Hence, it is essential that the system deployed to support AR/VR  application  be  highly  available  (i.e.,  must  have  minimal  downtime)  irrespective  of  the adopted deployment architecture. Consequently, maintaining high uptime of both computing and network resources deployed to enable AR/VR application deployment is necessary to ensure high availability and minimal loss of service.\n- Scalability: The scalability requirement of AR/VR applications is closely related to capacity and availability requirements as it is focused on scaling computing and network resources to deliver expected performance when there is a surge in the number of connected end-user devices and/or sensors. Consequently, an easily scalable infrastructural setup is preferred for AR/VR applications especially  in  scenarios  when  AR/VR  application  is  deployed  in use  cases  where  the  number  of connected  end-users  and  sensors  in  each  area  or  location  can  be  massive.

Thus,  leading  to  the  need  for  proportionally  sized distributed DCs across different locations. Hence, the modularity of the enabling infrastructure for AR/VR application is closely associated with the scalability requirement of AR/VR applications.\n- Sustainability: Sustainability is focused on the non-functional requirements of AR/VR applications under  different  use  cases  since  it  is  centred  around  the  eco-friendliness  and  power/energy efficiency  of  the  AR/VR  application  deployments.  This  requirement  aims  to  curtail  power consumption as well as carbon emissions associated with the use of AR/VR applications under all use cases. This is  of particular  importance  because  of expected  ubiquitous  adoption  of  AV/VR applications. Since AR/VR applications are known to be computationally intensive applications, wide deployment of AR/VR applications is expected to lead to high power consumption as well as high carbon emissions.\n- Adaptability: The adaptability requirement of an AR/VR application is associated with how well both computing and networking resources can be dynamically changed on-demand based on the present or desired state of the infrastructure. This may require automation and programmability of the infrastructure deployed for a specific use case of an AR/VR applications. Adaptability helps\n\nto improve the resilience of the AR/VR system since the programmability and automation of the adaptable  system  can  be  leveraged  to  seamlessly  respond  rapidly  to  disruptions  or  increased demands. Adaptability also promotes elasticity of the infrastructural setup used to support AR/VR applications. For example, installed compute resources and network resources can be logically scaled-up  or  scaled-down  based  on  changes  in  user  demands  for  AR/VR  applications.  Such elasticity  could  contribute  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  sustainability  requirement  of  AR/VR applications deployments  because  it encourages  proportional utilisation of the installed computing and networking resources.",

Based on the outlined requirements of AR/VR applications, this section discusses how C-PON network architecture, and its value propositions can contribute to the satisfaction of the listed  requirements  of  AR/VR  applications.  This  discussion  focuses  on  how  the  adoption  of  C-PON technology as a network fabric at edge and cloud processing locations can aid the satisfaction of the previously outlined requirements of AR/VR applications.

Subsequently,  the  section  discusses  how  that  stated  value  propositions  of  the  C-PON technology  can  contribute  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  outlined  requirements  for  AR/VR  applications deployment.\n\nAs defined in the ECOICE project business and technical annex and as summarised in Figure 10, the primary value propositions on C-PON include the following.\n\n- High data transmission speed : C-PON technology is capable of well over 100 Gb/s with the ability to deliver Terabits/s -'future proof' for faster and higher density servers and storage. Existing data electrical switching communication architecture has an inter-rack data traffic bottleneck that limits speed to mostly 10Gb/s even when the copper links are replaced with high-speed optical links.\n- Multiple high bandwidth inter-rack routes between servers : Avoids bottlenecks, reduces latency, increases resilience and configurability to allow real time load balancing.\n- Cellular architecture : Almost infinitely scalable, 'pay as you grow' inspiration from cellular mobile communications where millions of devices are connected with limited available bandwidth. It is inherently optimised for the fast-growing modular data centre market.\n- Multiplexing  capability :  Suitable  for  bolt-on  partial  PON  implementation  which  run  alongside existing data centre architecture which facilitates gradual adoption.\n- High energy efficiency : Reduces power consumption by up to 82% compared to conventional data centre networks with electronic switches.\n- Resilience : Paramount importance for service providers to ensure reliability and quality of services -directly linked with financial performance and competitiveness.\n\n- Low Capex cost : Cost savings of up to 43% compared to conventional switch networks.\n- SDN compatible :  Multiple software reconfigurable, high-bandwidth paths between servers and storage - ideal for virtualisation and software defined technologies (SDN).\n\nFigure 10: C-PON value propositions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe performance of C-PON relative to a conventional DCN can be measured by designing metrics to estimate the impact of the outlined value proposition of C-PON.",

This feature of C-PON network architecture can be effectively exploited when AR/VR applications adopt cloud-based or edge-based deployment architectures.

The  adoption  of  C-PON  in  edge  processing  setups  makes seamless horizonal and vertical scaling possible in this scenario. On one hand, edge computing capacity can  be  scaled,  by  increasing  the  size  of  the  cell,  to  satisfy  changing  demand  patterns  of  AR/VR applications.

Smart stadiums improve the fan experience by creating personalised services for fans. Such improved  experience  can  be  achieved  using  AR  and  VR  technologies  which  provide  new  ways  of experiencing live sports events via AR/VR-assisted events viewing. The AR/VR-assisted event viewing in smart stadiums aims to deliver a memorable user-centric immersive experience of events held at the stadium. AR/VR-assisted event viewing adopts extended reality (XR) technology to process captured contents from live events. These processed contents are subsequently sent back to fans at the location of  the  event  to  deliver  memorable  immersive  experiences  that  motivate  fans  to  return  for  similar experiences.  Consequently,  the  AR/VR-assisted  event  viewing  use  case  in  smart  stadiums  helps  to increase revenue.\n\nThe architectural setup of AR/VR-assisted event viewing in smart stadiums as illustrated in Figure 11 begins with distributed sensors (including IoT devices and cameras) which capture and encode video and data streams. Subsequently, the ecosystem leverages wired or wireless network infrastructure to transmit the captured streams to a remote processing location at the edge of the network i.e., an implementation of the edge-based deployment architecture. It is important to note that an edge-based deployment architecture is preferred because AR/VR-assisted event viewing in smart stadium is a delay critical use case of AR/VR applications. Furthermore, this use case of AR/VR applications also requires high bandwidth. Consequently, in addition to adopting the edge-based deployment architecture for AR/VR  applications,  5G  wireless  communication  technology  is  often  adopted  to  complement  the adoption  of  edge-based  architecture  for  AR/VR-assisted  event  viewing  in  smart  stadium.  This  is\n\nbecause 5G  technology offers  low  latency  and  high  bandwidth  communication  as  required  by  the AR/VR-assisted event viewing use case of AR/VR application.\n\nIn the edge computing pod, the captured and encoded content is decoded and stored prior to transformation of the collected data into insights by data analytics software and/or the rendering of video graphics by XR rendering software. Furthermore, a multimedia stitching software can be used to combine processed video, audio, and data streams. The output of multimedia stitching is subsequently retransmitted for presentation on smart end devices in the event arena. These smart end devices and the applications running on them deliver the enhanced experience to users (fans) by receiving and decoding the processed content sent from the edge computing pod.\n\nFigure 11: Architectural Overview for AR/VR-Assisted Event Viewing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section of the MS6 report has only given a summary of AR/VR-assisted event viewing in smart stadium.",

We give an overview of the C-PON card and OLM before giving details of the C-PON card development process. Thereafter, we describe the joint test scenario for the C-PON card and the OLM. We provided the results of quality of service and performance tests conducted for the C-PON card and OLM.\n- We achieved the technical deliverable DT14 within WP5 which is a report summarising initial tests of backplane and control software, with refinements using commercial development input from BT and Vodafone. We gave an overview of the backplane and control software. We also described the full mesh C-PON testbed that is adopted to conduct joint testing of the C-PON backplane and control software. The outcomes of the QoS testing performed on the C-PON testbed were reported.\n\nThis  document forms a detailed  report on the work undertaken on the C-PON platform of the ECOICE project from 1 st April 2023 to 30 th June 2023, focused on the two technical deliverables as well as progress on implementation of a testbed that adopts a conventional network architecture i.e., spine and leaf network architecture. The organisation of this report is as follows:\n\n- Section 1 is an introduction.\n- Section 2 reports joint tests of C-PON card and OLM of the C-PON testbed.\n- Section 3 reports initial tests of the backplane and the control software of the C-PON testbed.\n- Section 4 reports progress in the implementation of a spine and leaf testbed\n- Section 5 estimates and measures the power consumption of the new C-PON testbed and the state-of-the-art spine and leaf testbed, hence showing the power consumption savings as a result of the ECOICE project technologies (53% - 80%).",

    "text": "The C-PON card performs networking functions which include interfacing with physical media, parsing  of  packets,  temporary  storage  of  packets  and  forwarding  of  packets.  These  functions  are performed by a range of physical sub-components of the C-PON card. The physical sub-components comprise  network  interfaces,  forwarding  engines,  buffers,  and  traffic  managers.  The  Xilinx  U25 SmartNIC is adopted to develop the C-PON card in this project.\n\nThe OLM is a physical hardware that facilitates communications within the C-PON platform and between the C-PON platform and external systems by performing a range of essential functions. The features of the OLM are fundamental for performing end-to-end communication within the C-PON platform. Such features are enabled by the physical components of the OLM such as C-PON cards, backplanes,  computing  hardware  and  auxiliary  components.  The  C-PON  card  is  one  of  the  key components of the OLM. Therefore, the following section of the report provides details of the C-PON card development process before the outcomes of joint tests of the C-PON cards and the OLM are reported. The key performance metrics considered during the testing of C-PON card, and the OLM include performance and quality of service (QoS) metrics such as throughput, delay, jitter and packet loss. Power consumption is reported at the end of this document in a separate section for emphasis.\n\nThe  C-PON  card  is  a  programmable  Network  Interface  Card  (NIC)  utilised  to  carry  out networking functions.  The  C-PON  card  introduces  a  range  of  port  options  and  speeds  to  cater  for different data transfer requirements. Generally, the design of the C-PON cards depends on the data transfer  requirements.  However, in  this  project,  Xilinx  U25  SmartNIC  is  adopted  to  implement  the functionalities of the C-PON card.

A description of each step is given as follows:\n\nFigure 1: Steps for deploying P4 pipelines on the programmable SmartNIC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Design Entry: The design process begins with describing the desired circuit using a Hardware Description  Language  (HDL)  like  Verilog  or  VHDL.  This  step  involves  creating  or  importing Intellectual Property (IP) cores, which are pre-designed blocks that can be reused or customised within the design. Figure 2 shows a high-level FPGA block design of C-PON card.\n\nFigure 2: High-level FPGA block design of C-PON card.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Synthesis: The HDL code is synthesised into a gate-level representation, where logical elements and interconnections are defined using Xilinx library components. This step maps the high-level description to the actual FPGA resources.\n- -Implementation: During  implementation, the synthesised design is mapped onto the target Xilinx  FPGA device. This step involves placement and routing, where the logic elements are physically placed and interconnected using the FPGA's programmable interconnects. Figure 3 presents the FPGA design of the C-PON card.\n\nFigure 3: The FPGA design of C-PON card.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Verification: Once implemented, the design needs to be verified for functional correctness. Verification  involves  simulation  and  verification  of  IP  integration  to  ensure  that  the  design meets  the  desired  specifications.  The  C-PON  card  simulation  and  design  validation  are presented in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: C-PON Card simulation and design validation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Bitstream Generation: The final step in the programming flow is generating the bitstream file, which  contains  the  configuration  data  that  can  be  loaded  onto  the  FPGA.  The  bitstream configures the FPGA's internal resources and interconnections according to the design.\n- -FPGA Target Deployment: After generating the bitstream file, it can be deployed onto the Xilinx FPGA using various methods. Xilinx development boards typically provide multiple programming options, such as JTAG (Joint Test Action  Group)  programming, which  enables direct  programming through the JTAG interface, or standalone programming using external configuration memory devices.

Network testing can be generally categorised as follows:\n\n- -Performance  Testing: The  performance  testing  uses  various  traffic  loads  to  measure  the performance of network devices, such as routers, switches, and firewalls. It is used in assessing factors like throughput, latency, packet loss, and jitter under different network conditions.\n- -Quality of Service (QoS) Testing: This test evaluates specific traffic classes or prioritise traffic based  on  different  QoS  parameters.

We plan to consider other testing when the C-PON platform has advanced beyond TRL7. We leverage a comprehensive and specialised testing platform (i.e., Valkyrie Compact traffic  generator  and  analyser)  to  assess  and  analyse  the  important  performance  and  QoS  testing metrics. The Valkyrie platform includes a hardware traffic generator which injects the desired testing traffic into the network topology. The hardware traffic generator subsequently captures the testing traffic after it has traversed network devices and collects the measurements, such as the packet loss, delay, throughput, and jitter. The hardware traffic generator provides testing features which can be summarised as follows:\n\n- -Generation of different traffic patterns such as burst, constant, or periodic traffic, to evaluate network behaviour and device performance under realistic scenarios.\n- -The control of traffic rate which allows users to emulate different traffic loads and patterns. This helps to evaluate the network performance under varying conditions.\n\nTo  conduct  and  analyse  the  desired  testing  scenarios  of  the  C-PON  testbed,  we  seamlessly integrated Valkyrie Compact traffic generator into the setup.

    "text": "To obtain the delay results, traffic generation was rerun for 5 iterations where each was a duration of 10 seconds. Figure 11 depicts the average of these iterations at each traffic load increment. The forwarded traffic between the C-PON ports exhibits an average delay of 14 microseconds across a range of traffic loads spanning from 5 Gbps to 20 Gbps, as can be seen in Figure 11. This delay value is in line with values that are typically observed in store-and-forward Ethernet switching, which is usually within the  range  of  tens  of  microseconds.  Therefore,  the  C-PON  card's  performance  in  terms  of  delay  is comparable to industry standard performance.\n\nHowever, at the link speeds of 10 Gbps and 25Gbps, the average delay increases to approximately 15 microseconds. This leads to a noticeable increase in packet loss at these data rates as shown in Figure 13. The additional processing required to handle and forward packets efficiently at 10 Gbps and 25 Gbps introduces a delay that is more pronounced compared to other traffic loads.\n\nIt is important to note that while the average delay at 10 Gbps may be higher, it is still within an acceptable range considering the associated challenges of maintaining optimal performance at this specific data rate. Efforts will be made to further optimise the P4 pipelines or enhance the underlying hardware to reduce the impact on delay at 10 Gbps and 25 Gbps traffic loads. Attention to optimising performance and addressing potential packet loss issues at these link speeds can further enhance the overall performance of the C-PON card in demanding network environments.\n\nFigure 10: C-PON card DUT average throughput.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Jitter,  in  this  context,  refers  to  the  standard  deviation  of  the  random  delay experienced by Ethernet packets that are forwarded between the C-PON card's ingress and egress ports.\n\nThis reduction in jitter signifies that the C-PON card is effectively managing and controlling the packet flow by leveraging the enhanced backpressure feature and the optimised queuing memory to achieve a more reliable and consistent transmission of packets from the ingress to the egress ports. The decreased variability in delay differences between consecutive packets indicates the optimised synchronisation and enhanced efficiency in the packet forwarding process due to Xilinx implementing the IEEE 1588v2 standard for precision timing protocol (PTP) in the Alveo SmartNICs.\n\nJitter is usually expected to increase with traffic flow when the match-action engine is overloaded, however Xilinx SmartNICs are designed with a flow control mechanism which is equipped with 4 banks of Double Data Rate (DDR) memory each the size of 6GB. To further reduce queuing delay, the FPGA controls and minimise access to DDR memory using built in large quantities of small, internal RAM blocks. This enables pipeline-style computation which allows parallel traffic processing. These features are progressively utilised with traffic loads increase.\n\nBy  achieving  reduced  jitter  even  under  high  traffic  loads,  the  C-PON  card  demonstrates  its capability to provide reliable and stable packet forwarding, which is crucial for maintaining the QoS in data transmission.

Additionally, it provides useful insights to optimise the performance of the experimental designs and networking functions.\n\nIn the C-PON card DUT scenario, the overall average packet loss is 0.002%, as shown in Figure 13. This value is significantly low and falls well below the acceptable threshold for packet loss in audio and video  streaming  applications,  which  typically  ranges  around  1%  of  the  overall  packet  stream.  This indicates a high level of reliability in the tested networking device.

This  unexpected  packet  loss  pattern  requires  further  investigation  to  determine  the underlying reasons behind this abnormal behaviour. Addressing the causes of this irregular packet loss is  crucial as it  can directly impacts the overall performance of the C-PON cell.

Additionally, the backplane of a rack also enables the servers of that rack to access servers in other racks or cells within the C-PON platform. The optical backplane of the C-PON platform can be implemented with fibre Bragg grating or an optical polymer backplane or optical packet switches or optical  circuit  switches.  However,  technical  design  constraints  of  implementing these options have necessitated the use of an alternative backplane architecture for the C-PON testbed. This alternative backplane architecture is a representation of the polymer backplane. The optical polymer backplane offers higher capacity relative to other backplane options for the C-PON platform. Since, the polymer backplane is not commercially available, it can be represented at a small scale by a full mesh fabric. Therefore, a simple full mesh fabric is deployed to implement a backplane in each rack of the C-PON testbed. At higher TRL levels, beyond TRL6, we will explore scalability issues and the potential use of optical switches to simplify the design as all the routes in a full mesh are not all used at the same time.\n\nThe control software is the key enabler of communication between different entities in the C-PON testbed.  It  consists  of  algorithms,  protocols,  and  applications  that  dynamically  assign  and  manage network resources. In the C-PON testbed, the control software is implemented as a single centralised control  unit.  This  centralised  control  unit  resides  in  the  OLM  and  is  realised  via  the  open  network operating system (ONOS). ONOS is an open-source network operating system which can provide a software defined networking control plane for networks.\n\nThe backplane and the control software are important for establishing communication in the CPON platform. On the one hand, the backplane guarantees physical connectivity in the C-PON platform while the control software guarantees logical connectivity by providing the intelligence the enables end-to-end communication performed over physical devices. Initial testing of the backplane and the control software is conducted in this section. These tests include performance tests and QoS tests. Subsequently, the outcomes of these tests are reported.",

The throughput also measures the synchronisation consistency and the interaction robustness between the C-PON cell components across different traffic loads and conditions. Moreover, it helps  to identify potential  bottlenecks  that  may  occur  along  the  communication  path  at  any  network  device  or component.\n\nThe average end-to-end throughput is measured across a range of traffic loads, including 5 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 15 Gbps 20 Gbps and 25 Gbps, as illustrated in Figure 19. The results show a consistent throughput over the applied traffic loads with slight degradation at the link speeds of 5 Gbps and 25 Gbps. The slight decrease in throughput at 5 Gbps can be attributed to the initialisation state of the CPON  cell.  During  this  state,  the  control  software  initiates  the  MAC  learning  process  for  the interconnected  C-PON  cards,  which  temporarily  impacts  the  overall  throughput.  However,  as  the system stabilises, the throughput gradually improves.

Figure 21 gives an illustration of the obtained results.\n\nBuilding on the flow control mechanism provided by Xilinx as explained in point 3, section 2.3, the observed decrease in jitter indicates that the C-PON card, OLM, and full-mesh fabric can effectively manage and control the flow of ingress traffic packets. This achievement can be attributed to three main networking features i.e., the enhanced backpressure feature and optimised port forwarding in the C-PON card, minimised match-action flow entries processing, and the reliable physical links of the C-PON backplane. These networking features enable the consistent transmission of packets from a server in rack 1 (i.e., S1) to a server in rack 2 (i.e., S6) through the OLM (i.e., server S3 which acts as the OLM). The reduced variability in delay differences between consecutive packets signifies improved synchronisation and enhanced efficiency in the packet forwarding process.\n\nThe ability to achieve reduced jitter, even under high traffic loads, demonstrates the C-PON cell's capability to deliver reliable and stable packet forwarding. This reliability is vital for maintaining a highquality of service during data transmission.\n\nFigure 20: End-to-End average delay of full-mesh C-PON testbed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 21: Jitter of Full-mesh C-PON Testing Scenario.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are three types of the licences, namely the standard licence, the advanced licence, and the premium licence. Only standard and advanced licences are needed to complete the spine and leaf  setup.  All  switches  come  with  a  standard  licence  which provides  basic  and limited features.  The  advanced  licence  unlocks  more  features  such  as  enabling  advanced  routing protocols. Note that the advanced licence is only required for the spine switches.\n3.

Direct attached cables (DACs) are leveraged to provide the required connectivity.\n4.

Note  that  the  same configurations appeared in Figure 23 are used to configure the IP addresses.\n5. Configure routing protocol: The routing protocols are especially required to have communication between indirectly connected devices in the topology (such as communication between servers in different racks). Open shortest path first (OSPF) is the main routing protocol that is configured on all the switches.\n6. Perform initial  configuration  on  the  servers: This  step  involves  the  setup  of  the  operating systems (OS) in all servers, ensuring that the smart NICs are identified by the OS, and finally configuring the smart NICs to enable communication with the leaf switches.\n7. Connect the servers to the leaf switches in the same rack: In this step we connect the servers (i.e., three servers in each rack) to the leaf switches in the same rack. 25 Gbps DAC cables are used to provide such connectivity.

    "text": "In this section, the expected network power consumption of C-PON testbed and spine and leaf testbed  is  estimated  using  the  power  consumption  values  from  the  datasheet  of  the  components present in each testbed. Figure 25 and Figure 26 show the architecture of a DC testbeds where C-PON network  topology  and  spine  and  leaf  network  topology  are  deployed,  respectively.  When  the  DC testbed  adopts  the  C-PON  network  architecture  as  illustrated  in  Figure  25,  the  components  that contribute to total power consumption include the servers installed in each rack, the C-PON cards installed in each server, and the OLM and its subcomponents. On the other hand, for the spine and leaf network  topology  as  illustrated  in  Figure  26,  the  components  that  contribute  to  the  total  power consumption include the spine switches, the leaf switches, the servers installed in each rack as well as the NIC cards installed in each server. However, apart from the power consumption of the server that is  used to implement the OLM, the power consumption of other servers can be excluded since the servers are common across both network topologies.\n\nGiven the architecture of the DC testbeds as illustrated in Figure 25 and Figure 26 and the typical power consumption of the components in each architecture as illustrated Table 5, the network power consumption can be estimated. Additionally, the number of each component required in each network architecture depends on size on the testbed.\n\nTable 6 gives the quantity of network component in C-PON and spine and leaf testbeds.\n\nTable 5: Typical Power Consumption of Network Components.\n\n| Network Architecture   | Network Components     | Typical Power Consumption   |\n|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Spine and leaf         | Spine Switch (QFX5200) | 480W                        |\n\nTable 6: Quantity of Network Components in Testbeds.\n\n|       | Leaf Switch (QFX5120)   | 272W   |\n|-------|-------------------------|--------|\n|       | NIC card                | 75W    |\n| C-PON | x86 Server              | 300W   |\n|       | NIC card                | 75W    |\n\nFigure 25: C-PON testbed setup.\n\n| Network Components   | Quantity in C-PON Testbed   | Quantity in Spine and Leaf Testbed   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Spine Switch         | -                           | 2                                    |\n| Leaf Switch          | -                           | 2                                    |\n| NIC card             | 8                           | 6                                    |\n| x86 Server           | 1                           | -                                    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 26: Spine and leaf testbed setup.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUsing the testbeds setup for the ECOICE project, the difference between the power consumption of C-PON based network architecture and state of art spine and leaf-based network architecture is over 50% as shown in Table 7, where the power consumption of C-PON network is 53.9% lower than that of spine and leaf network.",

However, this savings achieved by C-PON is expected to increase to about 80% in a field deployment. In contrast to the simple spine and leaf testbed considered in this report which adopted basic spine and leaf switches because of budget constraints, the power consumption of the spine and leaf switches adopted for field deployments can be higher by a factor of three or more. Furthermore, the C-PON functionalities used less than a third of the FPGA as shown in Figure 3. Thus, a smaller FPGA can be used. The OLM does not need all the functionalities of a full server. This can lead to a further power consumption saving in C-PON at higher TRLs, thus approaching the estimated 80% power saving.\n\nTable 7: Power Consumption in Network Testbeds.\n\n|              | Unit Power      | C-PON    | C-PON                 | Spine and Leaf   | Spine and Leaf        |\n|--------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n| Components   | Consumption (W) | Quantity | Power Consumption (W) | Quantity         | Power Consumption (W) |\n| NIC card     | 75              | 8        | 600                   | 6                | 450                   |\n| Spine Switch | 480             | 0        | 0                     | 2                | 960                   |\n\n| Leaf Switch                     | 272                             | 0                               |   0 | 2   |   544 |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----|-----|-------|\n| Server                          | 300                             | 1                               | 300 | 0   |     0 |\n| Total Network Power Consumption | Total Network Power Consumption | Total Network Power Consumption | 900 |     |  1954 |",

    "text": "The estimated network power consumption in Table 7 is complemented by measuring the total power consumption in the C-PON testbed with the aid of power meters. These measurements are collected  when  the  components  in  the  C-PON  cell  are  actively  processing  traffic.  Furthermore, measurements are collected under a range of input traffic loads. Figure 27 shows the maximum power consumption of the C-PON testbed under 5 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 15 Gbps, 20 Gbps and 25 Gbps. The result shows that the power consumption of the C-PON system increases as the traffic load of the system increases.\n\nThe disparity between the estimated power consumption and the measured power consumption provides useful insights to optimise the design and development of C-PON components such as the OLM and C-PON. The disparity between the estimated power consumption and the measured power consumption implies that the current implementation of the C-PON platform did not to fully utilise the capabilities of the commercial hardware adopted. For example, since the power consumption of the each  smartNIC  card  in  the  C-PON  testbed  does  not  approach  specified  power  consumption  value provided in the Xilinx datasheet, it can be inferred that the computing capacity available on the Xilinx smart NIC exceeds the computing capacity required to implement a functional C-PON card. Likewise, the total power consumption measured for the C-PON testbed as illustrated in Figure 27 does not reflect  that  the  6  severs  deployed  to  create  the  C-PON  testbed,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  25,  are consuming the power specified in for SR665 Server. Therefore, future development efforts to take the C-PON platform to TRL 9 will focus on designing and implementing hardware that is proportionally sized to match the requirements of each C-PON platform component i.e., OLM and C-PON card. The power measurements were conducted using Multicomp Pro Plug-In Power Meters as shown in Figure 28 .\n\nIn the future deliverables of the ECOICE project, the power consumption measured for the C-PON testbed  as  depicted  in  Figure  27  will  be  compared  with  the  power  consumption  of  spine  and  leaf testbed.\n\nFigure 27: Maximum power consumption of C-PON testbed when in on-state.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 28 C-PON Test bed power measurements\n\n<!-- image -->",
